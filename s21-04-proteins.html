    <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch18_s04_p01">Each of the thousands of naturally occurring proteins has its own characteristic amino acid composition and sequence that result in a unique three-dimensional shape. Since the 1950s, scientists have determined the amino acid sequences and three-dimensional conformation of numerous proteins and thus obtained important clues on how each protein performs its specific function in the body.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch18_s04_p02">Proteins are compounds of high molar mass consisting largely or entirely of chains of amino acids. Because of their great complexity, protein molecules cannot be classified on the basis of specific structural similarities, as carbohydrates and lipids are categorized. The two major structural classifications of proteins are based on far more general qualities: whether the protein is (1) fiberlike and insoluble or (2) globular and soluble. Some proteins, such as those that compose hair, skin, muscles, and connective tissue, are fiberlike. These <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">fibrous proteins</a><span class="glossdef">A protein that is elongated or fiberlike and insoluble in water.</span></span> are insoluble in water and usually serve structural, connective, and protective functions. Examples of fibrous proteins are keratins, collagens, myosins, and elastins. Hair and the outer layer of skin are composed of keratin. Connective tissues contain collagen. Myosins are muscle proteins and are capable of contraction and extension. Elastins are found in ligaments and the elastic tissue of artery walls.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch18_s04_p03"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Globular proteins</a><span class="glossdef">A protein that is generally spherical in structure and soluble in water.</span></span>, the other major class, are soluble in aqueous media. In these proteins, the chains are folded so that the molecule as a whole is roughly spherical. Familiar examples include egg albumin from egg whites and serum albumin in blood. Serum albumin plays a major role in transporting fatty acids and maintaining a proper balance of osmotic pressures in the body. Hemoglobin and myoglobin, which are important for binding oxygen, are also globular proteins.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Levels of Protein Structure</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch18_s04_s01_p01">The structure of proteins is generally described as having four organizational levels. The first of these is the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">primary structure</a><span class="glossdef">The sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide chain or protein.</span></span>, which is the number and sequence of amino acids in a protein’s polypeptide chain or chains, beginning with the free amino group and maintained by the peptide bonds connecting each amino acid to the next. The primary structure of insulin, composed of 51 amino acids, is shown in <a class="xref" href="#gob-ch18_s04_s01_f01">Figure 18.2 "Primary Structure of Human Insulin"</a>.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch18_s04_s01_p02">A protein molecule is not a random tangle of polypeptide chains. Instead, the chains are arranged in unique but specific conformations. The term <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">secondary structure</a><span class="glossdef">The fixed arrangement of the polypeptide backbone.</span></span> refers to the fixed arrangement of the polypeptide backbone. On the basis of X ray studies, Linus Pauling and Robert Corey postulated that certain proteins or portions of proteins twist into a spiral or a helix. This helix is stabilized by <em class="emphasis">intrachain</em> hydrogen bonding between the carbonyl oxygen atom of one amino acid and the amide hydrogen atom four amino acids up the chain (located on the next turn of the helix) and is known as a right-handed α-helix. X ray data indicate that this helix makes one turn for every 3.6 amino acids, and the side chains of these amino acids project outward from the coiled backbone (<a class="xref" href="#gob-ch18_s04_s01_f02">Figure 18.3 "A Ball-and-Stick Model of an α-Helix"</a>). The α-keratins, found in hair and wool, are exclusively α-helical in conformation. Some proteins, such as gamma globulin, chymotrypsin, and cytochrome c, have little or no helical structure. Others, such as hemoglobin and myoglobin, are helical in certain regions but not in others.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch18_s04_s01_p03">Another common type of secondary structure, called the <em class="emphasis">β-pleated sheet conformation</em>, is a sheetlike arrangement in which two or more extended polypeptide chains (or separate regions on the same chain) are aligned side by side. The aligned segments can run either parallel or antiparallel—that is, the N-terminals can face in the same direction on adjacent chains or in different directions—and are connected by <em class="emphasis">interchain</em> hydrogen bonding (<a class="xref" href="#gob-ch18_s04_s01_f03">Figure 18.4 "A Ball-and-Stick Model of the β-Pleated Sheet Structure in Proteins"</a>).

Ionic bonds result from electrostatic attractions between positively and negatively charged side chains of amino acids.

Hydrogen bonding forms between a highly electronegative oxygen atom or a nitrogen atom and a hydrogen atom attached to another oxygen atom or a nitrogen atom, such as those found in polar amino acid side chains. Hydrogen bonding (as well as ionic attractions) is extremely important in both the intra- and intermolecular interactions of proteins (part (b) of <a class="xref" href="#gob-ch18_s04_s01_f05">Figure 18.6 "Tertiary Protein Structure Interactions"</a>).</p>

Intrachain disulfide linkages are found in many proteins, including insulin (yellow bars in <a class="xref" href="#gob-ch18_s04_s01_f01">Figure 18.2 "Primary Structure of Human Insulin"</a>) and have a strong stabilizing effect on the tertiary structure.</p>

Dispersion forces arise when a normally nonpolar atom becomes momentarily polar due to an uneven distribution of electrons, leading to an instantaneous dipole that induces a shift of electrons in a neighboring nonpolar atom. Dispersion forces are weak but can be important when other types of interactions are either missing or minimal (part (d) of <a class="xref" href="#gob-ch18_s04_s01_f05">Figure 18.6 "Tertiary Protein Structure Interactions"</a>). This is the case with fibroin, the major protein in silk, in which a high proportion of amino acids in the protein have nonpolar side chains. The term <em class="emphasis">hydrophobic interaction</em> is often misused as a synonym for dispersion forces. Hydrophobic interactions arise because water molecules engage in hydrogen bonding with other water molecules (or groups in proteins capable of hydrogen bonding). Because nonpolar groups cannot engage in hydrogen bonding, the protein folds in such a way that these groups are buried in the interior part of the protein structure, minimizing their contact with water.</p>

                <li>Proteins can be divided into two categories: fibrous, which tend to be insoluble in water, and globular, which are more soluble in water.</li>
                <li>A protein may have up to four levels of structure. The primary structure consists of the specific amino acid sequence. The resulting peptide chain can form an α-helix or β-pleated sheet (or local structures not as easily categorized), which is known as secondary structure. These segments of secondary structure are incorporated into the tertiary structure of the folded polypeptide chain. The quaternary structure describes the arrangements of subunits in a protein that contains more than one subunit.</li>
                <li>Four major types of attractive interactions determine the shape and stability of the folded protein: ionic bonding, hydrogen bonding, disulfide linkages, and dispersion forces.</li>
                <li>A wide variety of reagents and conditions can cause a protein to unfold or denature.</li>
