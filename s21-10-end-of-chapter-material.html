        <h3 class="title">Chapter Summary</h3>
        <p class="para" id="gob-ch18_s10_p01"><em class="emphasis">To ensure that you understand the material in this chapter, you should review the meanings of the bold terms in the following summary and ask yourself how they relate to the topics in the chapter.</em></p>
        <p class="para" id="gob-ch18_s10_p02">A <strong class="emphasis bold">protein</strong> is a large biological polymer synthesized from <strong class="emphasis bold">amino acids</strong>, which are carboxylic acids containing an α-amino group. Proteins have a variety of important roles in living organisms, yet they are made from the same 20 L-amino acids. About half of these amino acids, the <strong class="emphasis bold">essential amino acids</strong>, cannot be synthesized by the human body and must be obtained from the diet. In the solid state and in neutral solutions, amino acids exist as <strong class="emphasis bold">zwitterions</strong>, species that are charged but electrically neutral. In this form, they behave much like inorganic salts. Each amino acid belongs to one of four classes depending on the characteristics of its R group or amino acid side chain: nonpolar, polar but neutral, positively charged, and negatively charged. Depending on the conditions, amino acids can act as either acids or bases, which means that proteins act as buffers. The pH at which an amino acid exists as the zwitterion is called the <strong class="emphasis bold">isoelectric point (pI)</strong>.</p>
        <p class="para" id="gob-ch18_s10_p03">The amino acids in a protein are linked together by <strong class="emphasis bold">peptide bonds</strong>. Protein chains containing 10 or fewer amino acids are usually referred to as <strong class="emphasis bold">peptides</strong>, with a prefix such as di- or tri- indicating the number of amino acids. Chains containing more than 50 amino acid units are referred to as <em class="emphasis">proteins</em> or <strong class="emphasis bold">polypeptides</strong>. Proteins are classified globular or fibrous, depending on their structure and resulting solubility in water. <strong class="emphasis bold">Globular proteins</strong> are nearly spherical and are soluble in water; <strong class="emphasis bold">fibrous proteins</strong> have elongated or fibrous structures and are not soluble in water.</p>
        <p class="para" id="gob-ch18_s10_p04">Protein molecules can have as many as four levels of structure. The <strong class="emphasis bold">primary structure</strong> is the sequence of amino acids in the chain. The <strong class="emphasis bold">secondary structure</strong> is the arrangement of adjacent atoms in the peptide chain; the most common arrangements are α-helices or β-pleated sheets. The <strong class="emphasis bold">tertiary structure</strong> is the overall three-dimensional shape of the molecule that results from the way the chain bends and folds in on itself. Proteins that consist of more than one chain have <strong class="emphasis bold">quaternary structure</strong>, which is the way the multiple chains are packed together.</p>
        <p class="para" id="gob-ch18_s10_p05">Four types of intramolecular and intermolecular forces contribute to secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structure: (1) <strong class="emphasis bold">hydrogen bonding</strong> between an oxygen or a nitrogen atom and a hydrogen atom bound to an oxygen atom or a nitrogen atom, either on the same chain or on a neighboring chain; (2) <strong class="emphasis bold">ionic bonding</strong> between one positively charged side chain and one negatively charged side chain; (3) <strong class="emphasis bold">disulfide linkages</strong> between cysteine units; and (4) <strong class="emphasis bold">dispersion forces</strong> between nonpolar side chains.</p>
        <p class="para" id="gob-ch18_s10_p06">Because of their complexity, protein molecules are delicate and easy to disrupt. A <em class="emphasis">denatured</em> protein is one whose conformation has been changed, in a process called <strong class="emphasis bold">denaturation</strong>, so that it can no longer do its physiological job. A variety of conditions, such as heat, ultraviolet radiation, the addition of organic compounds, or changes in pH can denature a protein.</p>
        <p class="para" id="gob-ch18_s10_p07">An <strong class="emphasis bold">enzyme</strong> is an organic catalyst produced by a living cell. Enzymes are such powerful catalysts that the reactions they promote occur rapidly at body temperature. Without the help of enzymes, these reactions would require high temperatures and long reaction times.</p>
        <p class="para" id="gob-ch18_s10_p08">The molecule or molecules on which an enzyme acts are called its <strong class="emphasis bold">substrates</strong>. An enzyme has an <strong class="emphasis bold">active site</strong> where its substrate or substrates bind to form an enzyme-substrate complex. The reaction occurs, and product is released:</p>
        <span class="informalequation"><span class="mathphrase">E + S → E–S → E + P</span></span>
        <p class="para" id="gob-ch18_s10_p09">The original <strong class="emphasis bold">lock-and-key model</strong> of enzyme and substrate binding pictured a rigid enzyme of unchanging configuration binding to the appropriate substrate. The newer <strong class="emphasis bold">induced-fit model</strong> describes the enzyme active site as changing its conformation after binding to the substrate.</p>
        <p class="para" id="gob-ch18_s10_p10">Most enzymes have maximal activity in a narrow pH range centered on an <strong class="emphasis bold">optimum pH</strong>. In this pH range, the enzyme is correctly folded, and catalytic groups in the active site have the correct charge (positive, negative, or neutral). For most enzymes, the optimum pH is between 6 and 8.</p>
        <p class="para" id="gob-ch18_s10_p11">Substances that interfere with enzyme function are called inhibitors. An <strong class="emphasis bold">irreversible inhibitor</strong> inactivates enzymes by forming covalent bonds to the enzyme, while a <strong class="emphasis bold">reversible inhibitor</strong> inactivates an enzyme by a weaker, noncovalent interaction that is easier to disrupt. A <strong class="emphasis bold">competitive inhibitor</strong> is a reversible inhibitor that is structurally similar to the substrate and binds to the active site. When the inhibitor is bound, the substrate is blocked from the active site and no reaction occurs. Because the binding of such an inhibitor is reversible, a high substrate concentration will overcome the inhibition because it increases the likelihood of the substrate binding. A <strong class="emphasis bold">noncompetitive inhibitor</strong> binds reversibly at a site distinct from the active site. Thus, it can bind to either the enzyme or the enzyme-substrate complex. The inhibitor changes the conformation of the active site so that the enzyme cannot function properly. Noncompetitive inhibitors are important in <strong class="emphasis bold">feedback inhibition</strong>, in which the amount of product produced by a series of reactions is carefully controlled. The final product in a series of reactions acts as a noncompetitive inhibitor of the initial enzyme.</p>
        <p class="para" id="gob-ch18_s10_p12">Simple enzymes consist entirely of one or more amino acid chains. Complex enzymes are composed of one or more amino acid chains joined to <strong class="emphasis bold">cofactors</strong>—inorganic ions or organic <strong class="emphasis bold">coenzymes</strong>. <strong class="emphasis bold">Vitamins</strong> are organic compounds that are essential in very small amounts for the maintenance of normal metabolism and generally cannot be synthesized at adequate levels by the body. Vitamins are divided into two broad categories: <em class="emphasis">fat-soluble</em> vitamins and <em class="emphasis">water-soluble</em> vitamins. Many of the water-soluble vitamins are used for the synthesis of coenzymes.</p>
