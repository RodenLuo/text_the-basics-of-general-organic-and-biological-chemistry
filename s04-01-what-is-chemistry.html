Because the physical universe is so vast, there are many different branches of science (<a class="xref" href="#gob-ch01_s01_f01">Figure 1.1 "The Relationships between Some of the Major Branches of Science"</a>). Thus, chemistry is the study of matter, biology is the study of living things, and geology is the study of rocks and the earth. Mathematics is the language of science, and we will use it to communicate some of the ideas of chemistry.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch01_s01_p03">Although we divide science into different fields, there is much overlap among them. For example, some biologists and chemists work in both fields so much that their work is called biochemistry. Similarly, geology and chemistry overlap in the field called geochemistry. <a class="xref" href="#gob-ch01_s01_f01">Figure 1.1 "The Relationships between Some of the Major Branches of Science"</a> shows how many of the individual fields of science are related.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Looking Closer: Alchemy</h3>
        <p class="para" id="gob-ch01_s01_p05">As our understanding of the universe has changed over time, so has the practice of science. Chemistry in its modern form, based on principles that we consider valid today, was developed in the 1600s and 1700s. Before that, the study of matter was known as <em class="emphasis">alchemy</em> and was practiced mainly in China, Arabia, Egypt, and Europe.</p>
        <p class="para" id="gob-ch01_s01_p06">Alchemy was a somewhat mystical and secretive approach to learning how to manipulate matter. Practitioners, called alchemists, thought that all matter was composed of different proportions of the four basic elements—fire, water, earth, and air—and believed that if you changed the relative proportions of these elements in a substance, you could change the substance. The long-standing attempts to “transmute” common metals into gold represented one goal of alchemy. Alchemy’s other major goal was to synthesize the philosopher’s stone, a material that could impart long life—even immortality. Alchemists used symbols to represent substances, some of which are shown in the accompanying figure. This was not done to better communicate ideas, as chemists do today, but to maintain the secrecy of alchemical knowledge, keeping others from sharing in it.</p>

        <p class="para" id="gob-ch01_s01_p07">In spite of this secrecy, in its time alchemy was respected as a serious, scholarly endeavor. Isaac Newton, the great mathematician and physicist, was also an alchemist.</p>
