        <p class="para" id="gob-ch20_p01">The discovery of the link between insulin and diabetes led to a period of intense research aimed at understanding exactly how insulin works in the body to regulate glucose levels. Hormones in general act by binding to some protein, known as the hormone’s receptor, thus initiating a series of events that lead to a desired outcome. In the early 1970s, the insulin receptor was purified, and researchers began to study what happens after insulin binds to its receptor and how those events are linked to the uptake and metabolism of glucose in cells.</p>
        <p class="para" id="gob-ch20_p02">The insulin receptor is located in the cell membrane and consists of four polypeptide chains: two identical chains called α chains and two identical chains called β chains. The α chains, positioned on the outer surface of the membrane, consist of 735 amino acids each and contain the binding site for insulin. The β chains are integral membrane proteins, each composed of 620 amino acids. The binding of insulin to its receptor stimulates the β chains to catalyze the addition of phosphate groups to the specific side chains of tyrosine (referred to as phosphorylation) in the β chains and other cell proteins, leading to the activation of reactions that metabolize glucose. In this chapter we will look at the pathway that breaks down glucose—in response to activation by insulin—for the purpose of providing energy for the cell.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch20_p03">Life requires energy. Animals, for example, require heat energy to maintain body temperature, mechanical energy to move their limbs, and chemical energy to synthesize the compounds needed by their cells. Living cells remain organized and functioning properly only through a continual supply of energy. But only specific forms of energy can be used. Supplying a plant with energy by holding it in a flame will not prolong its life. On the other hand, a green plant is able to absorb radiant energy from the sun, the most abundant source of energy for life on the earth. Plants use this energy first to form glucose and then to make other carbohydrates, as well as lipids and proteins. Unlike plants, animals cannot directly use the sun’s energy to synthesize new compounds. They must eat plants or other animals to get carbohydrates, fats, and proteins and the chemical energy stored in them (<a class="xref" href="#gob-ch20_f02">Figure 20.2 "Some Energy Transformations in Living Systems"</a>). Once digested and transported to the cells, the nutrient molecules can be used in either of two ways: as building blocks for making new cell parts or repairing old ones or “burned” for energy.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch20_p07">These two equations summarize the biological combustion of a carbohydrate and a lipid by the cell through respiration. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Respiration</a><span class="glossdef">The process by which cells oxidize organic molecules in the presence of gaseous oxygen to produce carbon dioxide, water, and energy in the form of ATP.</span></span> is the collective name for all metabolic processes in which gaseous oxygen is used to oxidize organic matter to carbon dioxide, water, and energy.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch20_p08">Like the combustion of the common fuels we burn in our homes and cars (wood, coal, gasoline), respiration uses oxygen from the air to break down complex organic substances to carbon dioxide and water. But the energy released in the burning of wood is manifested entirely in the form of heat, and excess heat energy is not only useless but also injurious to the living cell. Living organisms instead conserve much of the energy respiration releases by channeling it into a series of stepwise reactions that produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) or other compounds that ultimately lead to the synthesis of ATP. The remainder of the energy is released as heat and manifested as body temperature. <a class="xref" href="gob-ch20_s01#gob-ch20_s01">Section 20.1 "ATP—the Universal Energy Currency"</a> examines the structure of ATP and begins to explore its role as the chemical energy carrier of the body.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch20_s01_p03">The pyrophosphate bond, symbolized by a squiggle (~), is hydrolyzed when ATP is converted to adenosine diphosphate (ADP). In this hydrolysis reaction, the products contain less energy than the reactants; there is a release of energy (&gt; 7 kcal/mol). One reason for the amount of energy released is that hydrolysis relieves the electron-electron repulsions experienced by the negatively charged phosphate groups when they are bonded to each other (<a class="xref" href="#gob-ch20_s01_f01">Figure 20.3 "Hydrolysis of ATP to Form ADP"</a>).</p>

In fact, ATP is the principal medium of energy exchange in biological systems. Many scientists call it the energy currency of cells.</p>

Several others are listed in <a class="xref" href="#gob-ch20_s01_t01">Table 20.1 "Energy Released by Hydrolysis of Some Phosphate Compounds"</a>. Notice, however, that the energy released when ATP is hydrolyzed is approximately midway between those of the high-energy and the low-energy phosphate compounds. This means that the hydrolysis of ATP can provide energy for the phosphorylation of the compounds below it in the table. For example, the hydrolysis of ATP provides sufficient energy for the phosphorylation of glucose to form glucose 1-phosphate. By the same token, the hydrolysis of compounds, such as creatine phosphate, that appear <em class="emphasis">above</em> ATP in the table can provide the energy needed to resynthesize ATP from ADP.</p>

We can think of catabolism as occurring in three stages (<a class="xref" href="#gob-ch20_s02_f01">Figure 20.4 "Energy Conversions"</a>). In stage I, carbohydrates, fats, and proteins are broken down into their individual monomer units: carbohydrates into simple sugars, fats into fatty acids and glycerol, and proteins into amino acids. One part of stage I of catabolism is the breakdown of food molecules by hydrolysis reactions into the individual monomer units—which occurs in the mouth, stomach, and small intestine—and is referred to as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">digestion</a><span class="glossdef">The breakdown of food molecules by hydrolysis reactions into the individual monomer units in the mouth, stomach, and small intestine.</span></span>.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch20_s02_p02">In stage II, these monomer units (or building blocks) are further broken down through different reaction pathways, one of which produces ATP, to form a common end product that can then be used in stage III to produce even more ATP. In this chapter, we will look at each stage of catabolism—as an overview and in detail.</p>

Cleavage of the glycosidic linkages produces a mixture of dextrins, maltose, and glucose. (For more information about carbohydrates, see <a class="xref" href="gob-ch16#gob-ch16">Chapter 16 "Carbohydrates"</a>.) The α-amylase mixed into the food remains active as the food passes through the esophagus, but it is rapidly inactivated in the acidic environment of the stomach.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch20_s02_s01_p02">The primary site of carbohydrate digestion is the small intestine. The secretion of α-amylase in the small intestine converts any remaining starch molecules, as well as the dextrins, to maltose. Maltose is then cleaved into two glucose molecules by maltase. Disaccharides such as sucrose and lactose are not digested until they reach the small intestine, where they are acted on by sucrase and lactase, respectively. The major products of the complete hydrolysis of disaccharides and polysaccharides are three monosaccharide units: glucose, fructose, and galactose. These are absorbed through the wall of the small intestine into the bloodstream.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch20_s02_s02_p03">The hydrochloric acid (HCl) in gastric juice is secreted by glands in the stomach lining. The pH of freshly secreted gastric juice is about 1.0, but the contents of the stomach may raise the pH to between 1.5 and 2.5. HCl helps to denature food proteins; that is, it unfolds the protein molecules to expose their chains to more efficient enzyme action. The principal digestive component of gastric juice is pepsinogen, an inactive enzyme produced in cells located in the stomach wall. When food enters the stomach after a period of fasting, pepsinogen is converted to its active form—pepsin—in a series of steps initiated by the drop in pH. Pepsin catalyzes the hydrolysis of peptide linkages within protein molecules. It has a fairly broad specificity but acts preferentially on linkages involving the aromatic amino acids tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine, as well as methionine and leucine.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch20_s02_s02_p04">Protein digestion is completed in the small intestine. Pancreatic juice, carried from the pancreas via the pancreatic duct, contains inactive enzymes such as trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen. They are activated in the small intestine as follows (<a class="xref" href="#gob-ch20_s02_s02_f02">Figure 20.7 "Activation of Some Pancreatic Enzymes in the Small Intestine"</a>): The intestinal mucosal cells secrete the proteolytic enzyme enteropeptidase, which converts trypsinogen to trypsin; trypsin then activates chymotrypsinogen to chymotrypsin (and also completes the activation of trypsinogen). Both of these active enzymes catalyze the hydrolysis of peptide bonds in protein chains. Chymotrypsin preferentially attacks peptide bonds involving the carboxyl groups of the aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine). Trypsin attacks peptide bonds involving the carboxyl groups of the basic amino acids (lysine and arginine). Pancreatic juice also contains procarboxypeptidase, which is cleaved by trypsin to carboxypeptidase. The latter is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of peptide linkages at the free carboxyl end of the peptide chain, resulting in the stepwise liberation of free amino acids from the carboxyl end of the polypeptide.</p>

A hormone secreted in this region stimulates the gallbladder to discharge bile into the duodenum. The principal constituents of bile are the bile salts, which emulsify large, water-insoluble lipid droplets, disrupting some of the hydrophobic interactions holding the lipid molecules together and suspending the resulting smaller globules (micelles) in the aqueous digestive medium. (For more information on bile salts, see <a class="xref" href="gob-ch17#gob-ch17">Chapter 17 "Lipids"</a>, <a class="xref" href="gob-ch17_s04#gob-ch17_s04">Section 17.4 "Steroids"</a>.) These changes greatly increase the surface area of the lipid particles, allowing for more intimate contact with the lipases and thus rapid digestion of the fats. Another hormone promotes the secretion of pancreatic juice, which contains these enzymes.</p>

The acetyl unit, derived (as we will see) from the breakdown of carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins, is attached to coenzyme A, making the acetyl unit more reactive. Acetyl-CoA is used in a myriad of biochemical pathways. For example, it may be used as the starting material for the biosynthesis of lipids (such as triglycerides, phospholipids, or cholesterol and other steroids). Most importantly for energy generation, it may enter the citric acid cycle and be oxidized to produce energy, if energy is needed and oxygen is available. The various fates or uses of acetyl-CoA are summarized in <a class="xref" href="#gob-ch20_s03_f02">Figure 20.11 "Cell Chemistry"</a>.</p>

The cyclical design of this complex series of reactions, which bring about the oxidation of the acetyl group of acetyl-CoA to carbon dioxide and water, was first proposed by Hans Krebs in 1937. (He was awarded the 1953 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.) Acetyl-CoA’s entrance into the citric acid cycle is the beginning of stage III of catabolism. The citric acid cycle produces adenosine triphosphate (ATP), reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH<sub class="subscript">2</sub>), and metabolic intermediates for the synthesis of needed compounds.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Steps of the Citric Acid Cycle</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch20_s04_s01_p01">At first glance, the citric acid cycle appears rather complex (<a class="xref" href="#gob-ch20_s04_s01_f01">Figure 20.12 "Reactions of the Citric Acid Cycle"</a>). All the reactions, however, are familiar types in organic chemistry: hydration, oxidation, decarboxylation, and hydrolysis. Each reaction of the citric acid cycle is numbered, and in <a class="xref" href="#gob-ch20_s04_s01_f01">Figure 20.12 "Reactions of the Citric Acid Cycle"</a>, the two acetyl carbon atoms are highlighted in red. Each intermediate in the cycle is a carboxylic acid, existing as an anion at physiological pH. All the reactions occur within the mitochondria, which are small organelles within the cells of plants and animals. We will look more closely at the structure of mitochondria in <a class="xref" href="gob-ch20_s05#gob-ch20_s05">Section 20.5 "Stage II of Carbohydrate Catabolism"</a>.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch20_s04_s01_p02">In the first reaction, acetyl-CoA enters the citric acid cycle, and the acetyl group is transferred onto oxaloacetate, yielding citrate. Note that this step releases coenzyme A. The reaction is catalyzed by <em class="emphasis">citrate synthase</em>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch20_s04_s01_p03">In the next step, <em class="emphasis">aconitase</em> catalyzes the isomerization of citrate to isocitrate. In this reaction, a tertiary alcohol, which cannot be oxidized, is converted to a secondary alcohol, which can be oxidized in the next step.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch20_s04_s01_p04">Isocitrate then undergoes a reaction known as oxidative decarboxylation because the alcohol is oxidized and the molecule is shortened by one carbon atom with the release of carbon dioxide (decarboxylation). The reaction is catalyzed by <em class="emphasis">isocitrate dehydrogenase</em>, and the product of the reaction is α-ketoglutarate. An important reaction linked to this is the reduction of the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup class="superscript">+</sup>) to NADH. The NADH is ultimately reoxidized, and the energy released is used in the synthesis of ATP, as we shall see.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch20_s04_s01_p05">The fourth step is another oxidative decarboxylation. This time α-ketoglutarate is converted to succinyl-CoA, and another molecule of NAD<sup class="superscript">+</sup> is reduced to NADH. The <em class="emphasis">α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex</em> catalyzes this reaction. This is the only irreversible reaction in the citric acid cycle. As such, it prevents the cycle from operating in the reverse direction, in which acetyl-CoA would be synthesized from carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch20_s04_s01_p06"><strong class="emphasis bold">Comment</strong>: So far, in the first four steps, two carbon atoms have entered the cycle as an acetyl group, and two carbon atoms have been released as molecules of carbon dioxide. The remaining reactions of the citric acid cycle use the four carbon atoms of the succinyl group to resynthesize a molecule of oxaloacetate, which is the compound needed to combine with an incoming acetyl group and begin another round of the cycle.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch20_s04_s01_p07">In the fifth reaction, the energy released by the hydrolysis of the high-energy thioester bond of succinyl-CoA is used to form guanosine triphosphate (GTP) from guanosine diphosphate (GDP) and inorganic phosphate in a reaction catalyzed by <em class="emphasis">succinyl-CoA synthetase</em>. This step is the only reaction in the citric acid cycle that directly forms a high-energy phosphate compound. GTP can readily transfer its terminal phosphate group to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to generate ATP in the presence of <em class="emphasis">nucleoside diphosphokinase</em>.</p>

This oxidation-reduction reaction uses flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), rather than NAD<sup class="superscript">+</sup>, as the oxidizing agent.

        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch20_s04_s01_p09">In the following step, a molecule of water is added to the double bond of fumarate to form L-malate in a reaction catalyzed by <em class="emphasis">fumarase</em>.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch20_s04_s02_p01">Respiration can be defined as the process by which cells oxidize organic molecules in the presence of gaseous oxygen to produce carbon dioxide, water, and energy in the form of ATP. We have seen that two carbon atoms enter the citric acid cycle from acetyl-CoA (step 1), and two different carbon atoms exit the cycle as carbon dioxide (steps 3 and 4). Yet nowhere in our discussion of the citric acid cycle have we indicated how oxygen is used. Recall, however, that in the four oxidation-reduction steps occurring in the citric acid cycle, the coenzyme NAD<sup class="superscript">+</sup> or FAD is reduced to NADH or FADH<sub class="subscript">2</sub>, respectively. <em class="emphasis">Oxygen is needed to reoxidize these coenzymes</em>. Recall, too, that very little ATP is obtained directly from the citric acid cycle. Instead, oxygen participation and significant ATP production occur subsequent to the citric acid cycle, in two pathways that are closely linked: electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch20_s04_s04_p03">Looking again at <a class="xref" href="#gob-ch20_s04_s03_f01">Figure 20.14 "The Mitochondrial Electron Transport Chain and ATP Synthase"</a>, we see that as electrons are being transferred through the electron transport chain, hydrogen (H<sup class="superscript">+</sup>) ions are being transported across the inner mitochondrial membrane from the matrix to the intermembrane space. The concentration of H<sup class="superscript">+</sup> is already higher in the intermembrane space than in the matrix, so energy is required to transport the additional H<sup class="superscript">+</sup> there. This energy comes from the electron transfer reactions in the electron transport chain. But how does the extreme difference in H<sup class="superscript">+</sup> concentration then lead to ATP synthesis? The buildup of H<sup class="superscript">+</sup> ions in the intermembrane space results in an H<sup class="superscript">+</sup> ion gradient that is a large energy source, like water behind a dam (because, given the opportunity, the protons will flow out of the intermembrane space and into the less concentrated matrix). Current research indicates that the flow of H<sup class="superscript">+</sup> down this concentration gradient through a fifth enzyme complex, known as ATP synthase, leads to a change in the structure of the synthase, causing the synthesis and release of ATP.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch20_s04_s04_p04">In cells that are using energy, the turnover of ATP is very high, so these cells contain high levels of ADP.

The individual reactions in glycolysis were determined during the first part of the 20th century. It was the first metabolic pathway to be elucidated, in part because the participating enzymes are found in soluble form in the cell and are readily isolated and purified. The pathway is structured so that the product of one enzyme-catalyzed reaction becomes the substrate of the next. The transfer of intermediates from one enzyme to the next occurs by diffusion.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch20_s05_s01_p01">The 10 reactions of glycolysis, summarized in <a class="xref" href="#gob-ch20_s05_s01_f01">Figure 20.16 "Glycolysis"</a>, can be divided into two phases. In the first 5 reactions—phase I—glucose is broken down into two molecules of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. In the last five reactions—phase II—each glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate is converted into pyruvate, and ATP is generated. Notice that all the intermediates in glycolysis are phosphorylated and contain either six or three carbon atoms.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch20_s05_s01_p02">When glucose enters a cell, it is immediately phosphorylated to form glucose 6-phosphate, in the first reaction of phase I. The phosphate donor in this reaction is ATP, and the enzyme—which requires magnesium ions for its activity—is <em class="emphasis">hexokinase</em>. In this reaction, ATP is being used rather than being synthesized. The presence of such a reaction in a catabolic pathway that is supposed to <em class="emphasis">generate</em> energy may surprise you. However, in addition to activating the glucose molecule, this initial reaction is essentially irreversible, an added benefit that keeps the overall process moving in the right direction. Furthermore, the addition of the negatively charged phosphate group prevents the intermediates formed in glycolysis from diffusing through the cell membrane, as neutral molecules such as glucose can do.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch20_s05_s01_p04">In the next reaction, <em class="emphasis">phosphoglucose isomerase</em> catalyzes the isomerization of glucose 6-phosphate to fructose 6-phosphate. This reaction is important because it creates a primary alcohol, which can be readily phosphorylated.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch20_s05_s01_p05">The subsequent phosphorylation of fructose 6-phosphate to form fructose 1,6-bisphosphate is catalyzed by <em class="emphasis">phosphofructokinase</em>, which requires magnesium ions for activity. ATP is again the phosphate donor.</p>

Although medical science has made significant progress against this disease, it continues to be a major health threat. Some of the serious complications of diabetes are as follows:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="gob-ch20_s05_s01_l01">
                <li>It is the leading cause of lower limb amputations in the United States.</li>

                <li>It increases the risk of having a heart attack or stroke by two to four times.</li>

            <p class="para" id="gob-ch20_s05_s01_p17">Because a person with diabetes is unable to use glucose properly, excessive quantities accumulate in the blood and the urine. Other characteristic symptoms are constant hunger, weight loss, extreme thirst, and frequent urination because the kidneys excrete large amounts of water in an attempt to remove excess sugar from the blood.</p>
            <p class="para" id="gob-ch20_s05_s01_p18">There are two types of diabetes. In immune-mediated diabetes, insufficient amounts of insulin are produced. This type of diabetes develops early in life and is also known as <em class="emphasis">Type 1 diabetes</em>, as well as insulin-dependent or juvenile-onset diabetes. Symptoms are rapidly reversed by the administration of insulin, and Type 1 diabetics can lead active lives provided they receive insulin as needed. Because insulin is a protein that is readily digested in the small intestine, it cannot be taken orally and must be injected at least once a day.</p>
            <p class="para" id="gob-ch20_s05_s01_p19">In Type 1 diabetes, insulin-producing cells of the pancreas are destroyed by the body’s immune system. Researchers are still trying to find out why. Meanwhile, they have developed a simple blood test capable of predicting who will develop Type 1 diabetes several years before the disease becomes apparent. The blood test reveals the presence of antibodies that destroy the body’s insulin-producing cells.</p>
            <p class="para" id="gob-ch20_s05_s01_p20"><em class="emphasis">Type 2 diabetes</em>, also known as noninsulin-dependent or adult-onset diabetes, is by far the more common, representing about 95% of diagnosed diabetic cases. (This translates to about 16 million Americans.) Type 2 diabetics usually produce sufficient amounts of insulin, but either the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas do not release enough of it, or it is not used properly because of defective insulin receptors or a lack of insulin receptors on the target cells. In many of these people, the disease can be controlled with a combination of diet and exercise alone. For some people who are overweight, losing weight is sufficient to bring their blood sugar level into the normal range, after which medication is not required if they exercise regularly and eat wisely.</p>
            <p class="para" id="gob-ch20_s05_s01_p21">Those who require medication may use oral antidiabetic drugs that stimulate the islet cells to secrete insulin. First-generation antidiabetic drugs stimulated the release of insulin. Newer second-generation drugs, such as glyburide, do as well, but they also increase the sensitivity of cell receptors to insulin. Some individuals with Type 2 diabetes do not produce enough insulin and thus do not respond to these oral medications; they must use insulin. In both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, the blood sugar level must be carefully monitored and adjustments made in diet or medication to keep the level as normal as possible (70–120 mg/dL).</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch20_s05_s02_p01">The presence or absence of oxygen determines the fates of the pyruvate and the NADH produced in glycolysis. When plenty of oxygen is available, pyruvate is completely oxidized to carbon dioxide, with the release of much greater amounts of ATP through the combined actions of the citric acid cycle, the electron transport chain, and oxidative phosphorylation. (For more information about oxidative phosphorylation, see <a class="xref" href="gob-ch20_s04#gob-ch20_s04">Section 20.4 "Stage III of Catabolism"</a>.) However, in the absence of oxygen (that is, under anaerobic conditions), the fate of pyruvate is different in different organisms. In vertebrates, pyruvate is converted to lactate, while other organisms, such as yeast, convert pyruvate to ethanol and carbon dioxide. These possible fates of pyruvate are summarized in <a class="xref" href="#gob-ch20_s05_s02_f01">Figure 20.17 "Metabolic Fates of Pyruvate"</a>. The conversion to lactate or ethanol under anaerobic conditions allows for the reoxidation of NADH to NAD<sup class="superscript">+</sup> in the absence of oxygen.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch20_s05_s03_p01">The net energy yield from anaerobic glucose metabolism can readily be calculated in moles of ATP. In the initial phosphorylation of glucose (step 1), 1 mol of ATP is expended, along with another in the phosphorylation of fructose 6-phosphate (step 3). In step 7, 2 mol of BPG (recall that 2 mol of 1,3-BPG are formed for each mole of glucose) are converted to 2 mol of 3-phosphoglycerate, and 2 mol of ATP are produced. In step 10, 2 mol of pyruvate and 2 mol of ATP are formed per mole of glucose.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch20_s05_s03_p02">For every mole of glucose degraded, 2 mol of ATP are initially consumed and 4 mol of ATP are ultimately produced. The net production of ATP is thus 2 mol for each mole of glucose converted to lactate or ethanol. If 7.4 kcal of energy is conserved per mole of ATP produced, and the total amount of energy that can theoretically be obtained from the complete oxidation of 1 mol of glucose is 670 kcal (as stated in the chapter introduction), the energy conserved in the anaerobic catabolism of glucose to two molecules of lactate (or ethanol) is as follows:</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch20_s05_s03_p03">Thus anaerobic cells extract only a very small fraction of the total energy of the glucose molecule.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch20_s05_s03_p04">Contrast this result with the amount of energy obtained when glucose is completely oxidized to carbon dioxide and water through glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, the electron transport chain, and oxidative phosphorylation as summarized in <a class="xref" href="#gob-ch20_s05_s03_t01">Table 20.3 "Maximum Yield of ATP from the Complete Oxidation of 1 Mol of Glucose"</a>. Note the indication in the table that a variable amount of ATP is synthesized, depending on the tissue, from the NADH formed in the cytoplasm during glycolysis. This is because NADH is not transported into the inner mitochondrial membrane where the enzymes for the electron transport chain are located. Instead, brain and muscle cells use a transport mechanism that passes electrons from the cytoplasmic NADH through the membrane to flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) molecules inside the mitochondria, forming reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH<sub class="subscript">2</sub>), which then feeds the electrons into the electron transport chain. This route lowers the yield of ATP to 1.5–2 molecules of ATP, rather than the usual 2.5–3 molecules. A more efficient transport system is found in liver, heart, and kidney cells where the formation of one cytoplasmic NADH molecule results in the formation of one mitochondrial NADH molecule, which leads to the formation of 2.5–3 molecules of ATP.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch20_s06_p01">Like glucose, the fatty acids released in the digestion of triglycerides and other lipids are broken down in a series of sequential reactions accompanied by the gradual release of usable energy. Some of these reactions are oxidative and require nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup class="superscript">+</sup>) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). The enzymes that participate in fatty acid catabolism are located in the mitochondria, along with the enzymes of the citric acid cycle, the electron transport chain, and oxidative phosphorylation. This localization of enzymes in the mitochondria is of the utmost importance because it facilitates efficient utilization of energy stored in fatty acids and other molecules.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch20_s06_p02">Fatty acid oxidation is initiated on the outer mitochondrial membrane. There the fatty acids, which like carbohydrates are relatively inert, must first be activated by conversion to an energy-rich fatty acid derivative of coenzyme A called <em class="emphasis">fatty acyl-coenzyme A</em> (CoA). The activation is catalyzed by <em class="emphasis">acyl-CoA synthetase</em>. For each molecule of fatty acid activated, one molecule of coenzyme A and one molecule of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) are used, equaling a net utilization of the two high-energy bonds in one ATP molecule (which is therefore converted to adenosine monophosphate [AMP] rather than adenosine diphosphate [ADP]):</p>

            <p class="para" id="gob-ch20_s06_s01_p10">In the liver, most of the acetyl-CoA obtained from fatty acid oxidation is oxidized by the citric acid cycle. However, some of the acetyl-CoA is used to synthesize a group of compounds known as <em class="emphasis">ketone bodies</em>: acetoacetate, β-hydroxybutyrate, and acetone. Two acetyl-CoA molecules combine, in a reversal of the final step of β-oxidation, to produce acetoacetyl-CoA. The acetoacetyl-CoA reacts with another molecule of acetyl-CoA and water to form β-hydroxy-β-methylglutaryl-CoA, which is then cleaved to acetoacetate and acetyl-CoA. Most of the acetoacetate is reduced to β-hydroxybutyrate, while a small amount is decarboxylated to carbon dioxide and acetone.</p>
            <div class="informalfigure large">

            <p class="para" id="gob-ch20_s06_s01_p11">The acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate synthesized by the liver are released into the blood for use as a metabolic fuel (to be converted back to acetyl-CoA) by other tissues, particularly the kidney and the heart. Thus, during prolonged starvation, ketone bodies provide about 70% of the energy requirements of the brain. Under normal conditions, the kidneys excrete about 20 mg of ketone bodies each day, and the blood levels are maintained at about 1 mg of ketone bodies per 100 mL of blood.</p>
            <p class="para" id="gob-ch20_s06_s01_p12">In starvation, diabetes mellitus, and certain other physiological conditions in which cells do not receive sufficient amounts of carbohydrate, the rate of fatty acid oxidation increases to provide energy. This leads to an increase in the concentration of acetyl-CoA. The increased acetyl-CoA cannot be oxidized by the citric acid cycle because of a decrease in the concentration of oxaloacetate, which is diverted to glucose synthesis. In response, the rate of ketone body formation in the liver increases further, to a level much higher than can be used by other tissues. The excess ketone bodies accumulate in the blood and the urine, a condition referred to as <em class="emphasis">ketosis</em>. When the acetone in the blood reaches the lungs, its volatility causes it to be expelled in the breath. The sweet smell of acetone, a characteristic of ketosis, is frequently noticed on the breath of severely diabetic patients.</p>
            <p class="para" id="gob-ch20_s06_s01_p13">Because two of the three kinds of ketone bodies are weak acids, their presence in the blood in excessive amounts overwhelms the blood buffers and causes a marked decrease in blood pH (to 6.9 from a normal value of 7.4). This decrease in pH leads to a serious condition known as <em class="emphasis">acidosis</em>. One of the effects of acidosis is a decrease in the ability of hemoglobin to transport oxygen in the blood. In moderate to severe acidosis, breathing becomes labored and very painful. The body also loses fluids and becomes dehydrated as the kidneys attempt to get rid of the acids by eliminating large quantities of water. The lowered oxygen supply and dehydration lead to depression; even mild acidosis leads to lethargy, loss of appetite, and a generally run-down feeling. Untreated patients may go into a coma. At that point, prompt treatment is necessary if the person’s life is to be saved.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">ATP Yield from Fatty Acid Oxidation</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch20_s06_s02_p01">The amount of ATP obtained from fatty acid oxidation depends on the size of the fatty acid being oxidized. For our purposes here. we’ll study palmitic acid, a saturated fatty acid with 16 carbon atoms, as a typical fatty acid in the human diet. Calculating its energy yield provides a model for determining the ATP yield of all other fatty acids.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch20_s06_s02_p02">The breakdown by an organism of 1 mol of palmitic acid requires 1 mol of ATP (for activation) and forms 8 mol of acetyl-CoA. Recall from <a class="xref" href="gob-ch20_s04#gob-ch20_s04_s04_t01">Table 20.2 "Maximum Yield of ATP from the Complete Oxidation of 1 Mol of Acetyl-CoA"</a> that each mole of acetyl-CoA metabolized by the citric acid cycle yields 10 mol of ATP. The complete degradation of 1 mol of palmitic acid requires the β-oxidation reactions to be repeated seven times. Thus, 7 mol of NADH and 7 mol of FADH<sub class="subscript">2</sub> are produced. Reoxidation of these compounds through respiration yields 2.5–3 and 1.5–2 mol of ATP, respectively. The energy calculations can be summarized as follows:</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch20_s07_p01">The liver is the principal site of amino acid metabolism, but other tissues, such as the kidney, the small intestine, muscles, and adipose tissue, take part. Generally, the first step in the breakdown of amino acids is the separation of the amino group from the carbon skeleton, usually by a transamination reaction. The carbon skeletons resulting from the deaminated amino acids are used to form either glucose or fats, or they are converted to a metabolic intermediate that can be oxidized by the citric acid cycle. The latter alternative, amino acid catabolism, is more likely to occur when glucose levels are low—for example, when a person is fasting or starving.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch20_s07_s03_p01">Any amino acid can be converted into an intermediate of the citric acid cycle. Once the amino group is removed, usually by transamination, the α-keto acid that remains is catabolized by a pathway unique to that acid and consisting of one or more reactions. For example, phenylalanine undergoes a series of six reactions before it splits into fumarate and acetoacetate. Fumarate is an intermediate in the citric acid cycle, while acetoacetate must be converted to acetoacetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) and then to acetyl-CoA before it enters the citric acid cycle.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch20_s07_s03_p02">Those amino acids that can form any of the intermediates of carbohydrate metabolism can subsequently be converted to glucose via a metabolic pathway known as gluconeogenesis.

        <h3 class="title">Chapter Summary</h3>
        <p class="para" id="gob-ch20_s08_p01"><em class="emphasis">To ensure that you understand the material in this chapter, you should review the meanings of the bold terms in the following summary and ask yourself how they relate to the topics in the chapter.</em></p>
        <p class="para" id="gob-ch20_s08_p02"><strong class="emphasis bold">Metabolism</strong> is the general term for all chemical reactions in living organisms. The two types of metabolism are <strong class="emphasis bold">catabolism</strong>—those reactions in which complex molecules (carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins) are broken down to simpler ones with the concomitant release of energy—and <strong class="emphasis bold">anabolism</strong>—those reactions that consume energy to build complex molecules. Metabolism is studied by looking at individual <strong class="emphasis bold">metabolic pathways</strong>, which are a series of biochemical reactions in which a given reactant is converted to a desired end product.</p>
        <p class="para" id="gob-ch20_s08_p03">The oxidation of fuel molecules (primarily carbohydrates and lipids), a process called <strong class="emphasis bold">respiration</strong>, is the source of energy used by cells. Catabolic reactions release energy from food molecules and use some of that energy for the synthesis of <em class="emphasis">adenosine triphosphate</em> (ATP); anabolic reactions use the energy in ATP to create new compounds. Catabolism can be divided into three stages. In stage I, carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins are broken down into their individual monomer units—simple sugars, fatty acids, and amino acids, respectively. In stage II, these monomer units are broken down by specific metabolic pathways to form a common end product <em class="emphasis">acetyl-coenzyme A</em> (CoA). In stage III, acetyl-CoA is completely oxidized to form carbon dioxide and water, and ATP is produced.</p>
        <p class="para" id="gob-ch20_s08_p04">The <strong class="emphasis bold">digestion</strong> of carbohydrates begins in the mouth as α-amylase breaks glycosidic linkages in carbohydrate molecules. Essentially no carbohydrate digestion occurs in the stomach, and food particles pass through to the small intestine, where α-amylase and intestinal enzymes convert complex carbohydrate molecules (starches) to monosaccharides. The monosaccharides then pass through the lining of the small intestine and into the bloodstream for transport to all body cells.</p>
        <p class="para" id="gob-ch20_s08_p05">Protein digestion begins in the stomach as pepsinogen in <strong class="emphasis bold">gastric juice</strong> is converted to pepsin, the enzyme that hydrolyzes peptide bonds. The partially digested protein then passes to the small intestine, where the remainder of protein digestion takes place through the action of several enzymes. The resulting amino acids cross the intestinal wall into the blood and are carried to the liver.</p>
        <p class="para" id="gob-ch20_s08_p06">Lipid digestion begins in the small intestine. Bile salts emulsify the lipid molecules, and then lipases hydrolyze them to fatty acids and monoglycerides. The hydrolysis products pass through the intestine and are repackaged for transport in the bloodstream.</p>
        <p class="para" id="gob-ch20_s08_p07">In cells that are operating aerobically, acetyl-CoA produced in stage II of catabolism is oxidized to carbon dioxide. The <strong class="emphasis bold">citric acid cycle</strong> describes this oxidation, which takes place with the formation of the coenzymes reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH<sub class="subscript">2</sub>). The sequence of reactions needed to oxidize these coenzymes and transfer the resulting electrons to oxygen is called the <strong class="emphasis bold">electron transport chain</strong>, or the <strong class="emphasis bold">respiratory chain</strong>. The compounds responsible for this series of oxidation-reduction reactions include proteins known as <strong class="emphasis bold">cytochromes</strong>, Fe·S proteins, and other molecules that ultimately result in the reduction of molecular oxygen to water. Every time a compound with two carbon atoms is oxidized in the citric acid cycle, a respiratory chain compound accepts the electrons lost in the oxidation (and so is reduced) and then passes them on to the next metabolite in the chain. The energy released by the electron transport chain is used to transport hydrogen (H<sup class="superscript">+</sup>) ions from the mitochondrial matrix to the intermembrane space. The flow of H<sup class="superscript">+</sup> back through ATP synthase leads to the synthesis and release of ATP from adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate ions (P<sub class="subscript">i</sub>) in a process known as <strong class="emphasis bold">oxidative phosphorylation</strong>. Electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation are tightly coupled to each other. The enzymes and intermediates of the citric acid cycle, the electron transport chain, and oxidative phosphorylation are located in organelles called <strong class="emphasis bold">mitochondria</strong>.</p>
        <p class="para" id="gob-ch20_s08_p08">The oxidation of carbohydrates is the source of over 50% of the energy used by cells. Glucose is oxidized to two molecules of pyruvate through a series of reactions known as <strong class="emphasis bold">glycolysis</strong>. Some of the energy released in these reactions is conserved by the formation of ATP from ADP. Glycolysis can be divided into two phases: phase I consists of the first five reactions and requires energy to “prime” the glucose molecule for phase II, the last five reactions in which ATP is produced through <strong class="emphasis bold">substrate-level phosphorylation</strong>.</p>
        <p class="para" id="gob-ch20_s08_p09">The pyruvate produced by glycolysis has several possible fates, depending on the organism and whether or not oxygen is present. In animal cells, pyruvate can be further oxidized to acetyl-CoA and then to carbon dioxide (through the citric acid cycle) if oxygen supplies are sufficient. When oxygen supplies are insufficient, pyruvate is reduced to lactate. In yeast and other microorganisms, pyruvate is not converted to lactate in the absence of oxygen but instead is converted to ethanol and carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p class="para" id="gob-ch20_s08_p10">The amount of ATP formed by the oxidation of glucose depends on whether or not oxygen is present. If oxygen is present, glucose is oxidized to carbon dioxide, and 36–38 ATP molecules are produced for each glucose molecule oxidized, using the combined pathways of glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, the electron transport chain, and oxidative phosphorylation. Thus, approximately 42% of the energy released by the complete oxidation of glucose is conserved by the synthesis of ATP. In the absence of oxygen, only 2 molecules of ATP are formed for each molecule of glucose converted to lactate (2 molecules), and the amount of energy conserved is much less (2%).</p>
        <p class="para" id="gob-ch20_s08_p11">Fatty acids, released by the degradation of triglycerides and other lipids, are converted to fatty acyl-CoA, transported into the mitochondria, and oxidized by repeated cycling through a sequence of four reactions known as <strong class="emphasis bold">β</strong>-<strong class="emphasis bold">oxidation</strong>. In each round of β-oxidation, the fatty acyl-CoA is shortened by two carbon atoms as one molecule of acetyl-CoA is formed. The final round of β-oxidation, once the chain has been shortened to four carbon atoms, forms two molecules of acetyl-CoA. β-oxidation also forms the reduced coenzymes FADH<sub class="subscript">2</sub> and NADH, whose reoxidation through the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation leads to the synthesis of ATP. The efficiency of fatty acid oxidation in the human body is approximately 41%.</p>
        <p class="para" id="gob-ch20_s08_p12">Amino acids from the breakdown of proteins can be catabolized to provide energy. Amino acids whose carbon skeletons are converted to intermediates that can be converted to glucose through gluconeogenesis are known as <strong class="emphasis bold">glucogenic amino acids</strong>. Amino acids whose carbon skeletons are broken down to compounds used to form ketone bodies are known as <strong class="emphasis bold">ketogenic amino acids</strong>.</p>
        <p class="para" id="gob-ch20_s08_p13">The first step in amino acid catabolism is separation of the amino group from the carbon skeleton. In a <strong class="emphasis bold">transamination</strong>, the amino acid gives its NH<sub class="subscript">2</sub> to pyruvate, α-ketoglutarate, or oxaloacetate. The products of this reaction are a new amino acid and an α-keto acid containing the carbon skeleton of the original amino acid. Pyruvate is transaminated to alanine, α-ketoglutarate to glutamate, and oxaloacetate to aspartate. The amino groups used to form alanine and aspartate are ultimately transferred to α-ketoglutarate, forming glutamate. The glutamate then undergoes <strong class="emphasis bold">oxidative deamination</strong> to yield α-ketoglutarate and ammonia.</p>
