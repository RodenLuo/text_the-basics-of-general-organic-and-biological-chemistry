    <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch16_s02_p01">The naturally occurring monosaccharides contain three to seven carbon atoms per molecule. Monosaccharides of specific sizes may be indicated by names composed of a stem denoting the number of carbon atoms and the suffix -<em class="emphasis">ose</em>. For example, the terms <em class="emphasis">triose</em>, <em class="emphasis">tetrose</em>, <em class="emphasis">pentose</em>, and <em class="emphasis">hexose</em> signify monosaccharides with, respectively, three, four, five, and six carbon atoms. Monosaccharides are also classified as aldoses or ketoses. Those monosaccharides that contain an aldehyde functional group are called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">aldoses</a><span class="glossdef">A monosaccharide that contains an aldehyde functional group.</span></span>; those containing a ketone functional group on the second carbon atom are <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">ketoses</a><span class="glossdef">A monosaccharide that contains a ketone functional group on the second carbon atom.</span></span>. Combining these classification systems gives general names that indicate both the type of carbonyl group <em class="emphasis">and</em> the number of carbon atoms in a molecule. Thus, monosaccharides are described as aldotetroses, aldopentoses, ketopentoses, ketoheptoses, and so forth. Glucose and fructose are specific examples of an aldohexose and a ketohexose, respectively.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch16_s02_p08">A key characteristic of enantiomers is that they have a carbon atom to which four different groups are attached. Note, for example, the four different groups attached to the central carbon atom of glyceraldehyde (part (a) of <a class="xref" href="#gob-ch16_s02_f01">Figure 16.2 "Structures of the Trioses"</a>). A carbon atom that has four different groups attached is a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">chiral carbon</a><span class="glossdef">A carbon atom that has four different groups attached to it.</span></span>. If a molecule contains one or more chiral carbons, it is likely to exist as two or more stereoisomers. Dihydroxyacetone does not contain a chiral carbon and thus does not exist as a pair of stereoisomers. Glyceraldehyde, however, has a chiral carbon and exists as a pair of enantiomers. Except for the direction in which each enantiomer rotates plane-polarized light, these two molecules have identical physical properties. One enantiomer has a specific rotation of +8.7°, while the other has a specific rotation of −8.7°.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch16_s02_p09">H. Emil Fischer, a German chemist, developed the convention commonly used for writing two-dimensional representations of the monosaccharides, such as those in part (a) of <a class="xref" href="#gob-ch16_s02_f01">Figure 16.2 "Structures of the Trioses"</a>. In these structural formulas, the aldehyde group is written at the top, and the hydrogen atoms and OH groups that are attached to each chiral carbon are written to the right or left. (If the monosaccharide is a ketose, the ketone functional group is the second carbon atom.) Vertical lines represent bonds pointing away from you, while horizontal lines represent bonds coming toward you. The formulas of chiral molecules represented in this manner are referred to as <em class="emphasis">Fischer projections</em>.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch16_s02_p10">The two enantiomers of glyceraldehyde are especially important because monosaccharides with more than three carbon atoms can be considered as being derived from them. Thus, D- and L-glyceraldehyde provide reference points for designating and drawing all other monosaccharides. Sugars whose Fischer projections terminate in the same configuration as D-glyceraldehyde are designated as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">D sugars</a><span class="glossdef">A sugar whose Fischer projection terminates in the same configuration as D-glyceraldehyde.</span></span>; those derived from L-glyceraldehyde are designated as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">L sugars</a><span class="glossdef">A sugar whose Fischer projection terminates in the same configuration as L-glyceraldehyde.</span></span>.</p>

        <p class="para" id="gob-ch16_s02_p12">A beam of ordinary light can be pictured as a bundle of waves; some move up and down, some sideways, and others at all other conceivable angles. When a beam of light has been polarized, however, the waves in the bundle all vibrate in a single plane. Light altered in this way is called <em class="emphasis">plane-polarized light</em>. Much of what chemists know about stereoisomers comes from studying the effects they have on plane-polarized light. In this illustration, the light on the left is not polarized, while that on the right is polarized.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para" id="gob-ch16_s02_p13">Sunlight, in general, is not polarized; light from an ordinary light bulb or an ordinary flashlight is not polarized. One way to polarize ordinary light is to pass it through Polaroid sheets, special plastic sheets containing carefully oriented organic compounds that permit only light vibrating in a single plane to pass through. To the eye, polarized light doesn’t “look” any different from nonpolarized light. We can detect polarized light, however, by using a second sheet of polarizing material, as shown here.</p>

In the photo on the right, the top Polaroid sheet has been rotated 90° and now blocks the plane-polarized light that comes through the first Polaroid sheet.</p>
        <p class="para" id="gob-ch16_s02_p15">Certain substances act on polarized light by rotating the plane of vibration. Such substances are said to be optically active. The extent of optical activity is measured by a polarimeter, an instrument that contains two polarizing lenses separated by a sample tube, as shown in the accompanying figure. With the sample tube empty, maximum light reaches the observer’s eye when the two lenses are aligned so that both pass light vibrating in the same plane. When an optically active substance is placed in the sample tube, that substance rotates the plane of polarization of the light passing through it, so that the polarized light emerging from the sample tube is vibrating in a different direction than when it entered the tube. To see the maximum amount of light when the sample is in place, the observer must rotate one lens to accommodate the change in the plane of polarization.</p>

        <p class="para" id="gob-ch16_s02_p16">Some optically active substances rotate the plane of polarized light to the right (clockwise) from the observer’s point of view. These compounds are said to be dextrorotatory; substances that rotate light to the left (counterclockwise) are levorotatory. To denote the direction of rotation, a positive sign (+) is given to dextrorotatory substances, and a negative sign (−) is given to levorotatory substances.</p>
