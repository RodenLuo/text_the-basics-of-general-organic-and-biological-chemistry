    <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch14_s10_p06">The solubility of aldehydes is therefore about the same as that of alcohols and ethers. Formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and acetone are soluble in water. As the carbon chain increases in length, solubility in water decreases. The borderline of solubility occurs at about four carbon atoms per oxygen atom. All aldehydes and ketones are soluble in organic solvents and, in general, are less dense than water.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch14_s10_s01_p01">Aldehydes and ketones are much alike in many of their reactions, owing to the presence of the carbonyl functional group in both. They differ greatly, however, in one most important type of reaction: oxidation. Aldehydes are readily oxidized to carboxylic acids, whereas ketones resist oxidation.</p>

A sufficiently mild oxidizing agent can distinguish aldehydes not only from ketones but also from alcohols.

        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch14_s10_s02_p01">Formaldehyde has an irritating odor. Because of its reactivity, it is difficult to handle in the gaseous state. For many uses, it is therefore dissolved in water and sold as a 37% to 40% aqueous solution called <em class="emphasis">formalin</em>. Formaldehyde denatures proteins, rendering them insoluble in water and resistant to bacterial decay. (For more information about proteins, see <a class="xref" href="gob-ch18#gob-ch18">Chapter 18 "Amino Acids, Proteins, and Enzymes"</a>, <a class="xref" href="gob-ch18_s04#gob-ch18_s04">Section 18.4 "Proteins"</a>.) For this reason, formalin is used in embalming solutions and in preserving biological specimens.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch14_s10_s02_p02">Aldehydes are the active components in many other familiar substances. Large quantities of formaldehyde are used to make phenol-formaldehyde resins for gluing the wood sheets in plywood and as adhesives in other building materials. Sometimes the formaldehyde escapes from the materials and causes health problems in some people. While some people seem unaffected, others experience coughing, wheezing, eye irritation, and other symptoms.</p>

            <p class="para" id="gob-ch14_s10_s02_p06">Acetone is formed in the human body as a by-product of lipid metabolism. (For more information about metabolic reactions, see <a class="xref" href="gob-ch20#gob-ch20">Chapter 20 "Energy Metabolism"</a>.) Normally, acetone does not accumulate to an appreciable extent because it is oxidized to carbon dioxide and water. The normal concentration of acetone in the human body is less than 1 mg/100 mL of blood. In certain disease states, such as uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, the acetone concentration rises to higher levels. It is then excreted in the urine, where it is easily detected. In severe cases, its odor can be noted on the breath.</p>
