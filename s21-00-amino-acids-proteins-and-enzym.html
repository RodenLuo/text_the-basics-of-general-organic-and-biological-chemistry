        <p class="para" id="gob-ch18_p01">The 1923 Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology was awarded to Frederick Grant Banting and John James Richard Macleod for their discovery of the protein <em class="emphasis">insulin</em>. In 1958, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Frederick Sanger for his discoveries concerning the structure of proteins and, in particular, the structure of insulin. What is so important about insulin that two Nobel Prizes have been awarded for work on this protein?</p>
        <p class="para" id="gob-ch18_p02">Insulin is a hormone that is synthesized in the pancreas. (For more information about hormones, see <a class="xref" href="gob-ch17#gob-ch17">Chapter 17 "Lipids"</a>, <a class="xref" href="gob-ch17_s04#gob-ch17_s04">Section 17.4 "Steroids"</a>.) Insulin stimulates the transport of glucose into cells throughout the body and the storage of glucose as glycogen. People with diabetes do not produce insulin or use it properly. The isolation of insulin in 1921 led to the first effective treatment for these individuals.</p>

Their masses range from several thousand to several million daltons (Da). In addition to carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms, all proteins contain nitrogen and sulfur atoms, and many also contain phosphorus atoms and traces of other elements. Proteins serve a variety of roles in living organisms and are often classified by these biological roles, which are summarized in <a class="xref" href="#gob-ch18_t01">Table 18.1 "Classification of Proteins by Biological Function"</a>. Muscle tissue is largely protein, as are skin and hair. Proteins are present in the blood, in the brain, and even in tooth enamel. Each type of cell in our bodies makes its own specialized proteins, as well as proteins common to all or most cells.</p>
