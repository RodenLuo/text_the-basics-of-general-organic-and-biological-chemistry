The cyclical design of this complex series of reactions, which bring about the oxidation of the acetyl group of acetyl-CoA to carbon dioxide and water, was first proposed by Hans Krebs in 1937. (He was awarded the 1953 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.) Acetyl-CoA’s entrance into the citric acid cycle is the beginning of stage III of catabolism. The citric acid cycle produces adenosine triphosphate (ATP), reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH<sub class="subscript">2</sub>), and metabolic intermediates for the synthesis of needed compounds.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Steps of the Citric Acid Cycle</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch20_s04_s01_p01">At first glance, the citric acid cycle appears rather complex (<a class="xref" href="#gob-ch20_s04_s01_f01">Figure 20.12 "Reactions of the Citric Acid Cycle"</a>). All the reactions, however, are familiar types in organic chemistry: hydration, oxidation, decarboxylation, and hydrolysis. Each reaction of the citric acid cycle is numbered, and in <a class="xref" href="#gob-ch20_s04_s01_f01">Figure 20.12 "Reactions of the Citric Acid Cycle"</a>, the two acetyl carbon atoms are highlighted in red. Each intermediate in the cycle is a carboxylic acid, existing as an anion at physiological pH. All the reactions occur within the mitochondria, which are small organelles within the cells of plants and animals. We will look more closely at the structure of mitochondria in <a class="xref" href="gob-ch20_s05#gob-ch20_s05">Section 20.5 "Stage II of Carbohydrate Catabolism"</a>.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch20_s04_s01_p02">In the first reaction, acetyl-CoA enters the citric acid cycle, and the acetyl group is transferred onto oxaloacetate, yielding citrate. Note that this step releases coenzyme A. The reaction is catalyzed by <em class="emphasis">citrate synthase</em>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch20_s04_s01_p03">In the next step, <em class="emphasis">aconitase</em> catalyzes the isomerization of citrate to isocitrate. In this reaction, a tertiary alcohol, which cannot be oxidized, is converted to a secondary alcohol, which can be oxidized in the next step.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch20_s04_s01_p04">Isocitrate then undergoes a reaction known as oxidative decarboxylation because the alcohol is oxidized and the molecule is shortened by one carbon atom with the release of carbon dioxide (decarboxylation). The reaction is catalyzed by <em class="emphasis">isocitrate dehydrogenase</em>, and the product of the reaction is α-ketoglutarate. An important reaction linked to this is the reduction of the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup class="superscript">+</sup>) to NADH. The NADH is ultimately reoxidized, and the energy released is used in the synthesis of ATP, as we shall see.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch20_s04_s01_p05">The fourth step is another oxidative decarboxylation. This time α-ketoglutarate is converted to succinyl-CoA, and another molecule of NAD<sup class="superscript">+</sup> is reduced to NADH. The <em class="emphasis">α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex</em> catalyzes this reaction. This is the only irreversible reaction in the citric acid cycle. As such, it prevents the cycle from operating in the reverse direction, in which acetyl-CoA would be synthesized from carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch20_s04_s01_p06"><strong class="emphasis bold">Comment</strong>: So far, in the first four steps, two carbon atoms have entered the cycle as an acetyl group, and two carbon atoms have been released as molecules of carbon dioxide. The remaining reactions of the citric acid cycle use the four carbon atoms of the succinyl group to resynthesize a molecule of oxaloacetate, which is the compound needed to combine with an incoming acetyl group and begin another round of the cycle.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch20_s04_s01_p07">In the fifth reaction, the energy released by the hydrolysis of the high-energy thioester bond of succinyl-CoA is used to form guanosine triphosphate (GTP) from guanosine diphosphate (GDP) and inorganic phosphate in a reaction catalyzed by <em class="emphasis">succinyl-CoA synthetase</em>. This step is the only reaction in the citric acid cycle that directly forms a high-energy phosphate compound. GTP can readily transfer its terminal phosphate group to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to generate ATP in the presence of <em class="emphasis">nucleoside diphosphokinase</em>.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch20_s04_s01_p09">In the following step, a molecule of water is added to the double bond of fumarate to form L-malate in a reaction catalyzed by <em class="emphasis">fumarase</em>.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Cellular Respiration</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch20_s04_s02_p01">Respiration can be defined as the process by which cells oxidize organic molecules in the presence of gaseous oxygen to produce carbon dioxide, water, and energy in the form of ATP. We have seen that two carbon atoms enter the citric acid cycle from acetyl-CoA (step 1), and two different carbon atoms exit the cycle as carbon dioxide (steps 3 and 4). Yet nowhere in our discussion of the citric acid cycle have we indicated how oxygen is used. Recall, however, that in the four oxidation-reduction steps occurring in the citric acid cycle, the coenzyme NAD<sup class="superscript">+</sup> or FAD is reduced to NADH or FADH<sub class="subscript">2</sub>, respectively. <em class="emphasis">Oxygen is needed to reoxidize these coenzymes</em>. Recall, too, that very little ATP is obtained directly from the citric acid cycle. Instead, oxygen participation and significant ATP production occur subsequent to the citric acid cycle, in two pathways that are closely linked: electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation.</p>

The inner membrane is extensively folded into a series of internal ridges called <em class="emphasis">cristae</em>. Thus there are two compartments in mitochondria: the <em class="emphasis">intermembrane space</em>, which lies between the membranes, and the <em class="emphasis">matrix</em>, which lies inside the inner membrane. The outer membrane is permeable, whereas the inner membrane is impermeable to most molecules and ions, although water, oxygen, and carbon dioxide can freely penetrate both membranes. The matrix contains all the enzymes of the citric acid cycle with the exception of succinate dehydrogenase, which is embedded in the inner membrane. The enzymes that are needed for the reoxidation of NADH and FADH<sub class="subscript">2</sub> and ATP production are also located in the inner membrane.

The other H<sup class="superscript">+</sup> ion is transported from the matrix, across the inner mitochondrial membrane, and into the intermembrane space. The NADH diffuses through the matrix and is bound by complex I of the electron transport chain. In the complex, the coenzyme flavin mononucleotide (FMN) accepts both electrons from NADH. By passing the electrons along, NADH is oxidized back to NAD<sup class="superscript">+</sup> and FMN is reduced to FMNH<sub class="subscript">2</sub> (reduced form of flavin mononucleotide).

        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch20_s04_s04_p03">Looking again at <a class="xref" href="#gob-ch20_s04_s03_f01">Figure 20.14 "The Mitochondrial Electron Transport Chain and ATP Synthase"</a>, we see that as electrons are being transferred through the electron transport chain, hydrogen (H<sup class="superscript">+</sup>) ions are being transported across the inner mitochondrial membrane from the matrix to the intermembrane space. The concentration of H<sup class="superscript">+</sup> is already higher in the intermembrane space than in the matrix, so energy is required to transport the additional H<sup class="superscript">+</sup> there. This energy comes from the electron transfer reactions in the electron transport chain. But how does the extreme difference in H<sup class="superscript">+</sup> concentration then lead to ATP synthesis? The buildup of H<sup class="superscript">+</sup> ions in the intermembrane space results in an H<sup class="superscript">+</sup> ion gradient that is a large energy source, like water behind a dam (because, given the opportunity, the protons will flow out of the intermembrane space and into the less concentrated matrix). Current research indicates that the flow of H<sup class="superscript">+</sup> down this concentration gradient through a fifth enzyme complex, known as ATP synthase, leads to a change in the structure of the synthase, causing the synthesis and release of ATP.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch20_s04_s04_p04">In cells that are using energy, the turnover of ATP is very high, so these cells contain high levels of ADP.

Consider, for example, that resting skeletal muscles use about 30% of a resting adult’s oxygen consumption, but when the same muscles are working strenuously, they account for almost 90% of the total oxygen consumption of the organism.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch20_s04_s04_p05">Experiment has shown that 2.5–3 ATP molecules are formed for every molecule of NADH oxidized in the electron transport chain, and 1.5–2 ATP molecules are formed for every molecule of FADH<sub class="subscript">2</sub> oxidized. <a class="xref" href="#gob-ch20_s04_s04_t01">Table 20.2 "Maximum Yield of ATP from the Complete Oxidation of 1 Mol of Acetyl-CoA"</a> summarizes the theoretical maximum yield of ATP produced by the complete oxidation of 1 mol of acetyl-CoA through the sequential action of the citric acid cycle, the electron transport chain, and oxidative phosphorylation.</p>
