    <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch08_s02_p01">Solids and liquids are collectively called <em class="emphasis">condensed phases</em> because their particles are in virtual contact. The two states share little else, however.</p>
    <div class="section" id="gob-ch08_s02_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Solids</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch08_s02_s01_p01">In the solid state, the individual particles of a substance are in fixed positions with respect to each other because there is not enough thermal energy to overcome the intermolecular interactions between the particles. As a result, solids have a definite shape and volume. Most solids are hard, but some (like waxes) are relatively soft. Many solids composed of ions can also be quite brittle.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch08_s02_s01_p02">Solids usually have their constituent particles arranged in a regular, three-dimensional array of alternating positive and negative ions called a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">crystal</a><span class="glossdef">A regular, three-dimensional array of alternating positive and negative ions.</span></span>. The effect of this regular arrangement of particles is sometimes visible macroscopically, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#gob-ch08_s02_s01_f01">Figure 8.7 "Crystalline Arrangement"</a>. Some solids, especially those composed of large molecules, cannot easily organize their particles in such regular crystals and exist as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">amorphous</a><span class="glossdef">A solid with no regular structure.</span></span> (literally, “without form”) solids. Glass is one example of an amorphous solid.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="gob-ch08_s02_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Liquids</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch08_s02_s02_p01">If the particles of a substance have enough energy to partially overcome intermolecular interactions, then the particles can move about each other while remaining in contact. This describes the liquid state. In a liquid, the particles are still in close contact, so liquids have a definite volume. However, because the particles can move about each other rather freely, a liquid has no definite shape and takes a shape dictated by its container.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="gob-ch08_s02_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Gases</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch08_s02_s03_p01">If the particles of a substance have enough energy to completely overcome intermolecular interactions, then the particles can separate from each other and move about randomly in space. This describes the gas state, which we will consider further in <a class="xref" href="gob-ch08_s03#gob-ch08_s03">Section 8.3 "Gases and Pressure"</a>. Like liquids, gases have no definite shape, but unlike solids and liquids, gases have no definite volume either. The change from solid to liquid usually does not significantly change the volume of a substance. However, the change from a liquid to a gas significantly increases the volume of a substance, by a factor of 1,000 or more. <a class="xref" href="#gob-ch08_s02_s03_f01">Figure 8.8 "A Representation of the Solid, Liquid, and Gas States"</a> shows the differences among solids, liquids, and gases at the molecular level, while <a class="xref" href="#gob-ch08_s02_s03_t01">Table 8.2 "Characteristics of the Three States of Matter"</a> lists the different characteristics of these states.</p>

            <p class="para" id="gob-ch08_s02_s03_p09">Earth is the only known body in our solar system that has liquid water existing freely on its surface. That is a good thing because life on Earth would not be possible without the presence of liquid water.</p>
            <p class="para" id="gob-ch08_s02_s03_p10">Water has several properties that make it a unique substance among substances. It is an excellent solvent; it dissolves many other substances and allows those substances to react when in solution. In fact, water is sometimes called the <em class="emphasis">universal solvent</em> because of this ability. Water has unusually high melting and boiling points (0°C and 100°C, respectively) for such a small molecule. The boiling points for similar-sized molecules, such as methane (BP = −162°C) and ammonia (BP = −33°C), are more than 100° lower. Though a liquid at normal temperatures, water molecules experience a relatively strong intermolecular interaction that allows them to maintain the liquid phase at higher temperatures than expected.</p>
            <p class="para" id="gob-ch08_s02_s03_p11">Unlike most substances, the solid form of water is less dense than its liquid form, which allows ice to float on water. In colder weather, lakes and rivers freeze from the top, allowing animals and plants to continue to live underneath. Water also requires an unusually large amount of energy to change temperature. While 100 J of energy will change the temperature of 1 g of Fe by 230°C, this same amount of energy will change the temperature of 1 g of H<sub class="subscript">2</sub>O by only 100°C. Thus, water changes its temperature slowly as heat is added or removed. This has a major impact on weather, as storm systems like hurricanes can be impacted by the amount of heat that ocean water can store.</p>
            <p class="para" id="gob-ch08_s02_s03_p12">Water’s influence on the world around us is affected by these properties. Isn’t it fascinating that such a small molecule can have such a big impact?</p>
