Cut one of those smaller pieces in half again. Continue cutting, making smaller and smaller pieces of aluminum foil.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch02_s02_p02">It should be obvious that the pieces are still aluminum foil; they are just becoming smaller and smaller. But how far can you take this exercise, at least in theory? Can you continue cutting the aluminum foil into halves forever, making smaller and smaller pieces? Or is there some limit, some absolute smallest piece of aluminum foil? (Thought experiments like this—and the conclusions based on them—were debated as far back as the fifth century BC.)</p>

In <a class="xref" href="gob-ch01#gob-ch01">Chapter 1 "Chemistry, Matter, and Measurement"</a>, we defined an atom as the smallest part of an element that maintains the identity of that element. Individual atoms are extremely small; even the largest atom has an approximate diameter of only 5.4 × 10<sup class="superscript">−10</sup> m. With that size, it takes over 18 million of these atoms, lined up side by side, to equal the width of your little finger (about 1 cm).</p>

For example, a macroscopic chunk of iron metal is composed, microscopically, of individual atoms. Some elements, however, exist as groups of atoms called molecules, as discussed in <a class="xref" href="gob-ch01#gob-ch01">Chapter 1 "Chemistry, Matter, and Measurement"</a>. Several important elements exist as two-atom combinations and are called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">diatomic molecules</a><span class="glossdef">A two-atom grouping that behaves as a single chemical entity.</span></span>. In representing a diatomic molecule, we use the symbol of the element and include the subscript 2 to indicate that two atoms of that element are joined together. The elements that exist as diatomic molecules are hydrogen (H<sub class="subscript">2</sub>), oxygen (O<sub class="subscript">2</sub>), nitrogen (N<sub class="subscript">2</sub>), fluorine (F<sub class="subscript">2</sub>), chlorine (Cl<sub class="subscript">2</sub>), bromine (Br<sub class="subscript">2</sub>), and iodine (I<sub class="subscript">2</sub>).</p>

        <h3 class="title">Looking Closer: Atomic Theory</h3>
        <p class="para" id="gob-ch02_s02_p05">Dalton’s ideas are called the <em class="emphasis">modern</em> atomic theory because the concept of atoms is very old. The Greek philosophers Leucippus and Democritus originally introduced atomic concepts in the fifth century BC. (The word <em class="emphasis">atom</em> comes from the Greek word <em class="emphasis">atomos</em>, which means “indivisible” or “uncuttable.”) Dalton had something that the ancient Greek philosophers didn’t have, however; he had experimental evidence, such as the formulas of simple chemicals and the behavior of gases. In the 150 years or so before Dalton, natural philosophy had been maturing into modern science, and the scientific method was being used to study nature. So when Dalton announced a modern atomic theory, he was proposing a fundamental theory to describe many previous observations of the natural world; he was not just participating in a philosophical discussion.</p>
