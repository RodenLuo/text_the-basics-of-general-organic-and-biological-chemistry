        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch17_s02_s01_p04">No single formula can be written to represent the naturally occurring fats and oils because they are highly complex mixtures of triglycerides in which many different fatty acids are represented. <a class="xref" href="#gob-ch17_s02_s01_t01">Table 17.2 "Average Fatty Acid Composition of Some Common Fats and Oils (%)*"</a> shows the fatty acid compositions of some common fats and oils. The composition of any given fat or oil can vary depending on the plant or animal species it comes from as well as on dietetic and climatic factors. To cite just one example, lard from corn-fed hogs is more highly saturated than lard from peanut-fed hogs. Palmitic acid is the most abundant of the saturated fatty acids, while oleic acid is the most abundant unsaturated fatty acid.</p>

The characteristic colors, odors, and flavors that we associate with some of them are imparted by foreign substances that are lipid soluble and have been absorbed by these lipids. For example, the yellow color of butter is due to the presence of the pigment carotene; the taste of butter comes from two compounds—diacetyl and 3-hydroxy-2-butanone—produced by bacteria in the ripening cream from which the butter is made.</p>

The hydrolysis of fats and oils in the presence of a base is used to make soap and is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">saponification</a><span class="glossdef">The hydrolysis of fats and oils in the presence of a base to make soap.</span></span>. Today most soaps are prepared through the hydrolysis of triglycerides (often from tallow, coconut oil, or both) using water under high pressure and temperature [700 lb/in<sup class="superscript">2</sup> (∼50 atm or 5,000 kPa) and 200°C].

            <h3 class="title">Looking Closer: Soaps</h3>
            <p class="para" id="gob-ch17_s02_s03_p02">Ordinary soap is a mixture of the sodium salts of various fatty acids, produced in one of the oldest organic syntheses practiced by humans (second only to the fermentation of sugars to produce ethyl alcohol). Both the Phoenicians (600 BCE) and the Romans made soap from animal fat and wood ash. Even so, the widespread production of soap did not begin until the 1700s. Soap was traditionally made by treating molten lard or tallow with a slight excess of alkali in large open vats. The mixture was heated, and steam was bubbled through it. After saponification was completed, the soap was precipitated from the mixture by the addition of sodium chloride (NaCl), removed by filtration, and washed several times with water. It was then dissolved in water and reprecipitated by the addition of more NaCl. The glycerol produced in the reaction was also recovered from the aqueous wash solutions.</p>
            <p class="para" id="gob-ch17_s02_s03_p03">Pumice or sand is added to produce scouring soap, while ingredients such as perfumes or dyes are added to produce fragrant, colored soaps. Blowing air through molten soap produces a floating soap. Soft soaps, made with potassium salts, are more expensive but produce a finer lather and are more soluble. They are used in liquid soaps, shampoos, and shaving creams.</p>
            <p class="para" id="gob-ch17_s02_s03_p04">Dirt and grime usually adhere to skin, clothing, and other surfaces by combining with body oils, cooking fats, lubricating greases, and similar substances that act like glues. Because these substances are not miscible in water, washing with water alone does little to remove them. Soap removes them, however, because soap molecules have a dual nature. One end, called the <em class="emphasis">head</em>, carries an ionic charge (a carboxylate anion) and therefore dissolves in water; the other end, the <em class="emphasis">tail</em>, has a hydrocarbon structure and dissolves in oils. The hydrocarbon tails dissolve in the soil; the ionic heads remain in the aqueous phase, and the soap breaks the oil into tiny soap-enclosed droplets called <em class="emphasis">micelles</em>, which disperse throughout the solution. (For more information about cell structure, see <a class="xref" href="gob-ch17_s03#gob-ch17_s03">Section 17.3 "Membranes and Membrane Lipids"</a>.) The droplets repel each other because of their charged surfaces and do not coalesce. With the oil no longer “gluing” the dirt to the soiled surface (skin, cloth, dish), the soap-enclosed dirt can easily be rinsed away.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch17_s02_s03_p05">The double bonds in fats and oils can undergo hydrogenation and also oxidation. The hydrogenation of vegetable oils to produce semisolid fats is an important process in the food industry. Chemically, it is essentially identical to the catalytic hydrogenation reaction described for alkenes in <a class="xref" href="gob-ch13#gob-ch13">Chapter 13 "Unsaturated and Aromatic Hydrocarbons"</a>, <a class="xref" href="gob-ch13_s04#gob-ch13_s04">Section 13.4 "Chemical Properties of Alkenes"</a>.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch17_s02_s03_p06">In commercial processes, the number of double bonds that are hydrogenated is carefully controlled to produce fats with the desired consistency (soft and pliable). Inexpensive and abundant vegetable oils (canola, corn, soybean) are thus transformed into margarine and cooking fats. In the preparation of margarine, for example, partially hydrogenated oils are mixed with water, salt, and nonfat dry milk, along with flavoring agents, coloring agents, and vitamins A and D, which are added to approximate the look, taste, and nutrition of butter. (Preservatives and antioxidants are also added.) In most commercial peanut butter, the peanut oil has been partially hydrogenated to prevent it from separating out. Consumers could decrease the amount of saturated fat in their diet by using the original unprocessed oils on their foods, but most people would rather spread margarine on their toast than pour oil on it.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch17_s02_s03_p07">Many people have switched from butter to margarine or vegetable shortening because of concerns that saturated animal fats can raise blood cholesterol levels and result in clogged arteries. However, during the hydrogenation of vegetable oils, an isomerization reaction occurs that produces the <em class="emphasis">trans</em> fatty acids mentioned in the opening essay. However, studies have shown that <em class="emphasis">trans</em> fatty acids also raise cholesterol levels and increase the incidence of heart disease. <em class="emphasis">Trans</em> fatty acids do not have the bend in their structures, which occurs in <em class="emphasis">cis</em> fatty acids and thus pack closely together in the same way that the saturated fatty acids do. Consumers are now being advised to use polyunsaturated oils and soft or liquid margarine and reduce their total fat consumption to less than 30% of their total calorie intake each day.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch17_s02_s03_p08">Fats and oils that are in contact with moist air at room temperature eventually undergo oxidation and hydrolysis reactions that cause them to turn rancid, acquiring a characteristic disagreeable odor. One cause of the odor is the release of volatile fatty acids by hydrolysis of the ester bonds. Butter, for example, releases foul-smelling butyric, caprylic, and capric acids. Microorganisms present in the air furnish lipases that catalyze this process. Hydrolytic rancidity can easily be prevented by covering the fat or oil and keeping it in a refrigerator.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch17_s02_s03_p09">Another cause of volatile, odorous compounds is the oxidation of the unsaturated fatty acid components, particularly the readily oxidized structural unit</p>

Antioxidants are compounds whose affinity for oxygen is greater than that of the lipids in the food; thus they function by preferentially depleting the supply of oxygen absorbed into the product. Because vitamin E has antioxidant properties, it helps reduce damage to lipids in the body, particularly to unsaturated fatty acids found in cell membrane lipids.</p>

                <li>Fats and oils are composed of molecules known as triglycerides, which are esters composed of three fatty acid units linked to glycerol.</li>
                <li>An increase in the percentage of shorter-chain fatty acids and/or unsaturated fatty acids lowers the melting point of a fat or oil.</li>
                <li>The hydrolysis of fats and oils in the presence of a base makes soap and is known as saponification.</li>
                <li>Double bonds present in unsaturated triglycerides can be hydrogenated to convert oils (liquid) into margarine (solid).</li>
                <li>The oxidation of fatty acids can form compounds with disagreeable odors. This oxidation can be minimized by the addition of antioxidants.</li>
