        <p class="para" id="gob-ch16_p01">In the United States, 17.9 million people have been diagnosed with diabetes, and experts estimate that at least another 5.7 million people have the disease but have not been diagnosed. In 2006, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death, listed on 72,507 death certificates. Moreover, it was a contributing factor in over 200,000 deaths in which the cause was listed as something else, such as heart or kidney disease.</p>
        <p class="para" id="gob-ch16_p02">People with diabetes are impaired in their ability to metabolize glucose, a sugar needed by the body for energy; as a result, excessive quantities of glucose accumulate in the blood and the urine. The characteristic symptoms of diabetes are weight loss, constant hunger, extreme thirst, and frequent urination (the kidneys excrete large amounts of water in an attempt to remove the excess sugar from the blood).</p>
        <p class="para" id="gob-ch16_p03">An important diagnostic test for diabetes is the <em class="emphasis">oral glucose tolerance test</em>, which measures the level of glucose in blood plasma. A first measurement is made after a fast of at least 8 h, followed by another measurement 2 h after the person drinks a flavored solution of 75 g of glucose dissolved in water. At the second measurement, the glucose plasma level should be no higher than 139 mg/dL. Individuals with a value between 140 and 199 mg/dL are diagnosed with prediabetes, while those with a value of 200 mg/dL or above are diagnosed with diabetes. Following a diagnosis of diabetes a person will need to monitor his or her blood glucose levels daily (or more often) using a glucose meter.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch16_s01_p09">(The 686 kcal come from solar energy.) Plants can use the glucose for energy or convert it to larger carbohydrates, such as starch or cellulose. Starch provides energy for later use, perhaps as nourishment for a plant’s seeds, while cellulose is the structural material of plants. We can gather and eat the parts of a plant that store energy—seeds, roots, tubers, and fruits—and use some of that energy ourselves. Carbohydrates are also needed for the synthesis of nucleic acids and many proteins and lipids.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch16_s02_p08">A key characteristic of enantiomers is that they have a carbon atom to which four different groups are attached. Note, for example, the four different groups attached to the central carbon atom of glyceraldehyde (part (a) of <a class="xref" href="#gob-ch16_s02_f01">Figure 16.2 "Structures of the Trioses"</a>). A carbon atom that has four different groups attached is a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">chiral carbon</a><span class="glossdef">A carbon atom that has four different groups attached to it.</span></span>. If a molecule contains one or more chiral carbons, it is likely to exist as two or more stereoisomers. Dihydroxyacetone does not contain a chiral carbon and thus does not exist as a pair of stereoisomers. Glyceraldehyde, however, has a chiral carbon and exists as a pair of enantiomers. Except for the direction in which each enantiomer rotates plane-polarized light, these two molecules have identical physical properties. One enantiomer has a specific rotation of +8.7°, while the other has a specific rotation of −8.7°.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch16_s02_p09">H. Emil Fischer, a German chemist, developed the convention commonly used for writing two-dimensional representations of the monosaccharides, such as those in part (a) of <a class="xref" href="#gob-ch16_s02_f01">Figure 16.2 "Structures of the Trioses"</a>. In these structural formulas, the aldehyde group is written at the top, and the hydrogen atoms and OH groups that are attached to each chiral carbon are written to the right or left. (If the monosaccharide is a ketose, the ketone functional group is the second carbon atom.) Vertical lines represent bonds pointing away from you, while horizontal lines represent bonds coming toward you. The formulas of chiral molecules represented in this manner are referred to as <em class="emphasis">Fischer projections</em>.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch16_s02_p10">The two enantiomers of glyceraldehyde are especially important because monosaccharides with more than three carbon atoms can be considered as being derived from them. Thus, D- and L-glyceraldehyde provide reference points for designating and drawing all other monosaccharides.

        <p class="para" id="gob-ch16_s02_p12">A beam of ordinary light can be pictured as a bundle of waves; some move up and down, some sideways, and others at all other conceivable angles. When a beam of light has been polarized, however, the waves in the bundle all vibrate in a single plane. Light altered in this way is called <em class="emphasis">plane-polarized light</em>. Much of what chemists know about stereoisomers comes from studying the effects they have on plane-polarized light. In this illustration, the light on the left is not polarized, while that on the right is polarized.</p>

        <p class="para" id="gob-ch16_s02_p13">Sunlight, in general, is not polarized; light from an ordinary light bulb or an ordinary flashlight is not polarized. One way to polarize ordinary light is to pass it through Polaroid sheets, special plastic sheets containing carefully oriented organic compounds that permit only light vibrating in a single plane to pass through. To the eye, polarized light doesn’t “look” any different from nonpolarized light. We can detect polarized light, however, by using a second sheet of polarizing material, as shown here.</p>

In the photo on the right, the top Polaroid sheet has been rotated 90° and now blocks the plane-polarized light that comes through the first Polaroid sheet.</p>
        <p class="para" id="gob-ch16_s02_p15">Certain substances act on polarized light by rotating the plane of vibration. Such substances are said to be optically active. The extent of optical activity is measured by a polarimeter, an instrument that contains two polarizing lenses separated by a sample tube, as shown in the accompanying figure. With the sample tube empty, maximum light reaches the observer’s eye when the two lenses are aligned so that both pass light vibrating in the same plane. When an optically active substance is placed in the sample tube, that substance rotates the plane of polarization of the light passing through it, so that the polarized light emerging from the sample tube is vibrating in a different direction than when it entered the tube. To see the maximum amount of light when the sample is in place, the observer must rotate one lens to accommodate the change in the plane of polarization.</p>

Glucose and galactose are both aldohexoses, while fructose is a ketohexose.</p>

    <div class="section" id="gob-ch16_s03_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Glucose</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch16_s03_s01_p01">D-Glucose, generally referred to as simply glucose, is the most abundant sugar found in nature; most of the carbohydrates we eat are eventually converted to it in a series of biochemical reactions that produce energy for our cells. It is also known by three other names: <em class="emphasis">dextrose</em>, from the fact that it rotates plane-polarized light in a clockwise (dextrorotatory) direction; <em class="emphasis">corn sugar</em> because in the United States cornstarch is used in the commercial process that produces glucose from the hydrolysis of starch; and <em class="emphasis">blood sugar</em> because it is the carbohydrate found in the circulatory system of animals. Normal blood sugar values range from 70 to 105 mg glucose/dL plasma, and normal urine may contain anywhere from a trace to 20 mg glucose/dL urine.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch16_s03_s01_p02">The Fischer projection of D-glucose is given in <a class="xref" href="gob-ch16_s04#gob-ch16_s04_f01">Figure 16.5 "Cyclization of D-Glucose"</a>. Glucose is a D sugar because the OH group on the fifth carbon atom (the chiral center farthest from the carbonyl group) is on the right. In fact, all the OH groups except the one on the third carbon atom are to the right.</p>

    <div class="section" id="gob-ch16_s03_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Galactose</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch16_s03_s02_p01">D-Galactose does not occur in nature in the uncombined state. It is released when lactose, a disaccharide found in milk, is hydrolyzed. The galactose needed by the human body for the synthesis of lactose is obtained by the metabolic conversion of D-glucose to D-galactose. Galactose is also an important constituent of the glycolipids that occur in the brain and the myelin sheath of nerve cells. (For more information about glycolipids, see <a class="xref" href="gob-ch17#gob-ch17">Chapter 17 "Lipids"</a>, <a class="xref" href="gob-ch17_s03#gob-ch17_s03">Section 17.3 "Membranes and Membrane Lipids"</a>.) For this reason it is also known as <em class="emphasis">brain sugar</em>. The structure of D-galactose is shown in <a class="xref" href="#gob-ch16_s03_f01">Figure 16.4 "Structures of Three Important Hexoses"</a>. Notice that the configuration differs from that of glucose only at the fourth carbon atom.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Fructose</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch16_s03_s03_p01">D-Fructose, also shown in <a class="xref" href="#gob-ch16_s03_f01">Figure 16.4 "Structures of Three Important Hexoses"</a>, is the most abundant ketohexose. Note that from the third through the sixth carbon atoms, its structure is the same as that of glucose. It occurs, along with glucose and sucrose, in honey (which is 40% fructose) and sweet fruits. Fructose (from the Latin <em class="emphasis">fructus</em>, meaning “fruit”) is also referred to as <em class="emphasis">levulose</em> because it has a specific rotation that is strongly levorotatory (−92.4°). It is the sweetest sugar, being 1.7 times sweeter than sucrose, although many nonsugars are several hundred or several thousand times as sweet (<a class="xref" href="#gob-ch16_s03_s03_t01">Table 16.1 "The Relative Sweetness of Some Compounds (Sucrose = 100)"</a>).</p>

            <h3 class="title">Looking Closer: Artificial Sweeteners</h3>
            <p class="para" id="gob-ch16_s03_s03_p02">Although sweetness is commonly associated with mono- and disaccharides, it is not a property found only in sugars. Several other kinds of organic compounds have been synthesized that are far superior as sweetening agents. These so-called high-intensity or artificial sweeteners are useful for people with diabetes or other medical conditions that require them to control their carbohydrate intake. The synthetic compounds are noncaloric or used in such small quantities that they do not add significantly to the caloric value of food.</p>
            <p class="para" id="gob-ch16_s03_s03_p03">The first artificial sweetener—saccharin—was discovered by accident in 1879. It is 300 times sweeter than sucrose, but it passes through the body unchanged and thus adds no calories to the diet. After its discovery, saccharin was used until it was banned in the early 1900s. However, during the sugar-short years of World War I, the ban was lifted and was not reinstated at the war’s end. One drawback to the use of saccharin is its bitter, metallic aftertaste. The initial solution to this problem was to combine saccharin with cyclamate, a second artificial sweetener discovered in 1937.</p>
            <p class="para" id="gob-ch16_s03_s03_p04">In the 1960s and 1970s, several clinical tests with laboratory animals implicated both cyclamate and saccharin as carcinogenic (cancer-causing) substances. The results from the cyclamate tests were completed first, and cyclamate was banned in the United States in 1969. Then a major study was released in Canada in 1977 indicating that saccharin increased the incidence of bladder cancer in rats. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) proposed a ban on saccharin that raised immediate public opposition because saccharin was the only artificial sweetener still available. In response, Congress passed the Saccharin Study and Labeling Act in 1977, permitting the use of saccharin as long as any product containing it was labeled with a consumer warning regarding the possible elevation of the risk of bladder cancer. Today this warning is no longer required; moreover, the FDA is currently reviewing the ban on cyclamate, as 75 additional studies and years of usage in other countries, such as Canada, have failed to show that it has any carcinogenic effect.</p>
            <p class="para" id="gob-ch16_s03_s03_p05">A third artificial sweetener, aspartame, was discovered in 1965. This white crystalline compound is about 180 times sweeter than sucrose and has no aftertaste. It was approved for use in 1981 and is used to sweeten a wide variety of foods because it blends well with other food flavors. Aspartame is not used in baked goods, however, because it is not heat stable.</p>
            <p class="para" id="gob-ch16_s03_s03_p06">In the body (or when heated), aspartame is initially hydrolyzed to three molecules: the amino acids aspartic acid and phenylalanine and an alcohol methanol. Repeated controversy regarding the safety of aspartame arises partly from the fact that the body metabolizes the released methanol to formaldehyde. It should be noted, though, that a glass of tomato juice has six times as much methanol as a similar amount of a diet soda containing aspartame. The only documented risk connected to aspartame use is for individuals with the genetic disease <em class="emphasis">phenylketonuria</em> (PKU); these individuals lack the enzyme needed to metabolize the phenylalanine released when aspartame is broken down by the body. Because of the danger to people with PKU, all products containing aspartame must carry a warning label.</p>
            <p class="para" id="gob-ch16_s03_s03_p07">Acesulfame K, discovered just two years after aspartame (1967), was approved for use in the United States in 1988. It is 200 times sweeter than sugar and, unlike aspartame, is heat stable. It has no lingering aftertaste.</p>
            <p class="para" id="gob-ch16_s03_s03_p08">One of the newest artificial sweeteners to gain FDA approval (April 1998) for use in the United States is sucralose, a white crystalline solid approximately 600 times sweeter than sucrose. Sucralose is synthesized from sucrose and has three chlorine atoms substituted for three OH groups. It is noncaloric because it passes through the body unchanged. It can be used in baking because it is heat stable.</p>
            <p class="para" id="gob-ch16_s03_s03_p09">All of the extensive clinical studies completed to date have indicated that these artificial sweeteners approved for use in the United States are safe for consumption by healthy individuals in moderate amounts.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch16_s04_p01">So far we have represented monosaccharides as linear molecules, but many of them also adopt cyclic structures. This conversion occurs because of the ability of aldehydes and ketones to react with alcohols:</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch16_s04_p02">In some cases, OH and carbonyl groups on the same molecule are able to react with one another in an intramolecular reaction. Thus, monosaccharides larger than tetroses exist mainly as cyclic compounds (<a class="xref" href="#gob-ch16_s04_f01">Figure 16.5 "Cyclization of D-Glucose"</a>). You might wonder why the aldehyde reacts with the OH group on the fifth carbon atom rather than the OH group on the second carbon atom next to it. Recall from <a class="xref" href="gob-ch12#gob-ch12">Chapter 12 "Organic Chemistry: Alkanes and Halogenated Hydrocarbons"</a>, <a class="xref" href="gob-ch12_s09#gob-ch12_s09">Section 12.9 "Cycloalkanes"</a>, that cyclic alkanes containing five or six carbon atoms in the ring are the most stable. The same is true for monosaccharides that form cyclic structures: rings consisting of five or six carbon atoms are the most stable.</p>

The structure shown on the left side of <a class="xref" href="#gob-ch16_s04_f02">Figure 16.6 "Monosaccharides"</a>, with the OH group on the first carbon atom projected downward, represent what is called the <em class="emphasis">alpha (α) form</em>.

        <p class="para">In an aqueous solution, monosaccharides exist as an equilibrium mixture of three forms. The interconversion between the forms is known as <em class="emphasis">mutarotation</em>, which is shown for D-glucose (a) and D-fructose (b).</p>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch16_s04_p04">It is possible to obtain a sample of crystalline glucose in which all the molecules have the α structure or all have the β structure. The α form melts at 146°C and has a specific rotation of +112°, while the β form melts at 150°C and has a specific rotation of +18.7°. When the sample is dissolved in water, however, a mixture is soon produced containing both anomers as well as the straight-chain form, in dynamic equilibrium (part (a) of <a class="xref" href="#gob-ch16_s04_f02">Figure 16.6 "Monosaccharides"</a>). You can start with a pure crystalline sample of glucose consisting entirely of either anomer, but as soon as the molecules dissolve in water, they open to form the carbonyl group and then reclose to form either the α or the β anomer. The opening and closing repeats continuously in an ongoing interconversion between anomeric forms and is referred to as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">mutarotation</a><span class="glossdef">The ongoing interconversion between anomeric forms of a monosaccharide to form an equilibrium mixture.</span></span> (Latin <em class="emphasis">mutare</em>, meaning “to change”). At equilibrium, the mixture consists of about 36% α-D-glucose, 64% β-D-glucose, and less than 0.02% of the open-chain aldehyde form. The observed rotation of this solution is +52.7°.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch16_s04_p05">Even though only a small percentage of the molecules are in the open-chain aldehyde form at any time, the solution will nevertheless exhibit the characteristic reactions of an aldehyde. As the small amount of free aldehyde is used up in a reaction, there is a shift in the equilibrium to yield more aldehyde. Thus, <em class="emphasis">all</em> the molecules may eventually react, even though very little free aldehyde is present at a time.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch16_s04_p06">In <a class="xref" href="#gob-ch16_s04_f01">Figure 16.5 "Cyclization of D-Glucose"</a> and <a class="xref" href="#gob-ch16_s04_f02">Figure 16.6 "Monosaccharides"</a>, and elsewhere in this book, the cyclic forms of sugars are depicted using a convention first suggested by Walter N. Haworth, an English chemist. The molecules are drawn as planar hexagons with a darkened edge representing the side facing toward the viewer. The structure is simplified to show only the functional groups attached to the carbon atoms. Any group written to the right in a Fischer projection appears below the plane of the ring in a Haworth projection, and any group written to the left in a Fischer projection appears above the plane in a Haworth projection.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch16_s04_p07">The difference between the α and the β forms of sugars may seem trivial, but such structural differences are often crucial in biochemical reactions. This explains why we can get energy from the starch in potatoes and other plants but not from cellulose, even though both starch and cellulose are polysaccharides composed of glucose molecules linked together. We will examine the effects of these differences more closely in <a class="xref" href="gob-ch16_s07#gob-ch16_s07">Section 16.7 "Polysaccharides"</a> and when we discuss enzyme specificity in <a class="xref" href="gob-ch18#gob-ch18">Chapter 18 "Amino Acids, Proteins, and Enzymes"</a>, <a class="xref" href="gob-ch18_s05#gob-ch18_s05">Section 18.5 "Enzymes"</a>.</p>

The chemical behavior of these monosaccharides is likewise determined by their functional groups.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch16_s05_p02">An important reaction of monosaccharides is the oxidation of the aldehyde group, one of the most easily oxidized organic functional groups. Aldehyde oxidation can be accomplished with any mild oxidizing agent, such as Tollens’ reagent or Benedict’s reagent. (For more information about aldehyde oxidation, see <a class="xref" href="gob-ch14#gob-ch14">Chapter 14 "Organic Compounds of Oxygen"</a>, <a class="xref" href="gob-ch14_s05#gob-ch14_s05">Section 14.5 "Reactions of Alcohols"</a>.) With the latter, complexed copper(II) ions are reduced to copper(I) ions that form a brick-red precipitate [copper(I) oxide; <a class="xref" href="#gob-ch16_s05_f01">Figure 16.7 "Benedict’s Test"</a>].</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch16_s06_p02">The disaccharides differ from one another in their monosaccharide constituents and in the specific type of glycosidic linkage connecting them. There are three common disaccharides: maltose, lactose, and sucrose. All three are white crystalline solids at room temperature and are soluble in water. We’ll consider each sugar in more detail.</p>
    <div class="section" id="gob-ch16_s06_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Maltose</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch16_s06_s01_p01">Maltose occurs to a limited extent in sprouting grain. It is formed most often by the partial hydrolysis of starch and glycogen. In the manufacture of beer, maltose is liberated by the action of malt (germinating barley) on starch; for this reason, it is often referred to as <em class="emphasis">malt sugar</em>. Maltose is about 30% as sweet as sucrose. The human body is unable to metabolize maltose or any other disaccharide directly from the diet because the molecules are too large to pass through the cell membranes of the intestinal wall. Therefore, an ingested disaccharide must first be broken down by hydrolysis into its two constituent monosaccharide units. In the body, such hydrolysis reactions are catalyzed by enzymes such as <em class="emphasis">maltase</em>. The same reactions can be carried out in the laboratory with dilute acid as a catalyst, although in that case the rate is much slower, and high temperatures are required. Whether it occurs in the body or a glass beaker, the hydrolysis of maltose produces two molecules of D-glucose.</p>
        <span class="informalequation block"><math xml:id="gob-16_m001" display="block"> <semantics> <mrow> <mtext>maltose </mtext><mover><mo>→</mo><mrow><msup><mtext>H</mtext><mtext>+</mtext></msup><mtext> or maltase</mtext></mrow></mover><mtext> 2 D-glucose</mtext></mrow>  </semantics></math></span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch16_s06_s01_p02">Maltose is a reducing sugar. Thus, its two glucose molecules must be linked in such a way as to leave one anomeric carbon that can open to form an aldehyde group. The glucose units in maltose are joined in a <em class="emphasis">head-to-tail</em> fashion through an α-linkage from the first carbon atom of one glucose molecule to the fourth carbon atom of the second glucose molecule (that is, an α-1,4-glycosidic linkage; see <a class="xref" href="#gob-ch16_s06_s01_f01">Figure 16.8 "An Equilibrium Mixture of Maltose Isomers"</a>). The bond from the anomeric carbon of the first monosaccharide unit is directed downward, which is why this is known as an α-glycosidic linkage. The OH group on the anomeric carbon of the second glucose can be in either the α or the β position, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#gob-ch16_s06_s01_f01">Figure 16.8 "An Equilibrium Mixture of Maltose Isomers"</a>.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch16_s06_s02_p01">Lactose is known as <em class="emphasis">milk sugar</em> because it occurs in the milk of humans, cows, and other mammals. In fact, the natural synthesis of lactose occurs only in mammary tissue, whereas most other carbohydrates are plant products. Human milk contains about 7.5% lactose, and cow’s milk contains about 4.5%. This sugar is one of the lowest ranking in terms of sweetness, being about one-sixth as sweet as sucrose (see <a class="xref" href="gob-ch16_s03#gob-ch16_s03_s03_t01">Table 16.1 "The Relative Sweetness of Some Compounds (Sucrose = 100)"</a> in <a class="xref" href="gob-ch16_s03#gob-ch16_s03">Section 16.3 "Important Hexoses"</a>). Lactose is produced commercially from whey, a by-product in the manufacture of cheese. It is important as an infant food and in the production of penicillin.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch16_s06_s02_p02">Lactose is a reducing sugar composed of one molecule of D-galactose and one molecule of D-glucose joined by a β-1,4-glycosidic bond (the bond from the anomeric carbon of the first monosaccharide unit being directed upward).

            <h3 class="title">To Your Health: Lactose Intolerance and Galactosemia</h3>
            <p class="para" id="gob-ch16_s06_s02_p08">Lactose makes up about 40% of an infant’s diet during the first year of life. Infants and small children have one form of the enzyme lactase in their small intestines and can digest the sugar easily; however, adults usually have a less active form of the enzyme, and about 70% of the world’s adult population has some deficiency in its production. As a result, many adults experience a reduction in the ability to hydrolyze lactose to galactose and glucose in their small intestine. For some people the inability to synthesize sufficient enzyme increases with age. Up to 20% of the US population suffers some degree of lactose intolerance.</p>
            <p class="para" id="gob-ch16_s06_s02_p09">In people with lactose intolerance, some of the unhydrolyzed lactose passes into the colon, where it tends to draw water from the interstitial fluid into the intestinal lumen by osmosis. At the same time, intestinal bacteria may act on the lactose to produce organic acids and gases. The buildup of water and bacterial decay products leads to abdominal distention, cramps, and diarrhea, which are symptoms of the condition.</p>
            <p class="para" id="gob-ch16_s06_s02_p10">The symptoms disappear if milk or other sources of lactose are excluded from the diet or consumed only sparingly. Alternatively, many food stores now carry special brands of milk that have been pretreated with lactase to hydrolyze the lactose. Cooking or fermenting milk causes at least partial hydrolysis of the lactose, so some people with lactose intolerance are still able to enjoy cheese, yogurt, or cooked foods containing milk. The most common treatment for lactose intolerance, however, is the use of lactase preparations (e.g., Lactaid), which are available in liquid and tablet form at drugstores and grocery stores. These are taken orally with dairy foods—or may be added to them directly—to assist in their digestion.</p>
            <p class="para" id="gob-ch16_s06_s02_p11">Galactosemia is a condition in which one of the enzymes needed to convert galactose to glucose is missing. Consequently, the blood galactose level is markedly elevated, and galactose is found in the urine. An infant with galactosemia experiences a lack of appetite, weight loss, diarrhea, and jaundice. The disease may result in impaired liver function, cataracts, mental retardation, and even death. If galactosemia is recognized in early infancy, its effects can be prevented by the exclusion of milk and all other sources of galactose from the diet. As a child with galactosemia grows older, he or she usually develops an alternate pathway for metabolizing galactose, so the need to restrict milk is not permanent. The incidence of galactosemia in the United States is 1 in every 65,000 newborn babies.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Sucrose</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch16_s06_s03_p01">Sucrose, probably the largest-selling pure organic compound in the world, is known as <em class="emphasis">beet sugar</em>, <em class="emphasis">cane sugar</em>, <em class="emphasis">table sugar</em>, or simply <em class="emphasis">sugar</em>. Most of the sucrose sold commercially is obtained from sugar cane and sugar beets (whose juices are 14%–20% sucrose) by evaporation of the water and recrystallization. The dark brown liquid that remains after the recrystallization of sugar is sold as molasses.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch16_s06_s03_p02">The sucrose molecule is unique among the common disaccharides in having an α-1,β-2-glycosidic (head-to-head) linkage. Because this glycosidic linkage is formed by the OH group on the anomeric carbon of α-D-glucose and the OH group on the anomeric carbon of β-D-fructose, it ties up the anomeric carbons of both glucose and fructose.</p>
        <div class="informalfigure large block">
            <img src="section_19/760d20a66330a0aba1a196431f7bc177.jpg">
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch16_s06_s03_p03">This linkage gives sucrose certain properties that are quite different from those of maltose and lactose. As long as the sucrose molecule remains intact, neither monosaccharide “uncyclizes” to form an open-chain structure. Thus, sucrose is incapable of mutarotation and exists in only one form both in the solid state and in solution. In addition, sucrose does not undergo reactions that are typical of aldehydes and ketones. Therefore, sucrose is a nonreducing sugar.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch16_s06_s03_p04">The hydrolysis of sucrose in dilute acid or through the action of the enzyme <em class="emphasis">sucrase</em> (also known as invertase) gives an equimolar mixture of glucose and fructose. This 1:1 mixture is referred to as <em class="emphasis">invert sugar</em> because it rotates plane-polarized light in the opposite direction than sucrose. The hydrolysis reaction has several practical applications. Sucrose readily recrystallizes from a solution, but invert sugar has a much greater tendency to remain in solution. In the manufacture of jelly and candy and in the canning of fruit, the recrystallization of sugar is undesirable. Therefore, conditions leading to the hydrolysis of sucrose are employed in these processes. Moreover, because fructose is sweeter than sucrose, the hydrolysis adds to the sweetening effect. Bees carry out this reaction when they make honey.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch16_s06_s03_p05">The average American consumes more than 100 lb of sucrose every year. About two-thirds of this amount is ingested in soft drinks, presweetened cereals, and other highly processed foods. The widespread use of sucrose is a contributing factor to obesity and tooth decay. Carbohydrates such as sucrose, are converted to fat when the caloric intake exceeds the body’s requirements, and sucrose causes tooth decay by promoting the formation of plaque that sticks to teeth.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch16_s07_p01">The polysaccharides are the most abundant carbohydrates in nature and serve a variety of functions, such as energy storage or as components of plant cell walls. Polysaccharides are very large polymers composed of tens to thousands of monosaccharides joined together by glycosidic linkages. The three most abundant polysaccharides are starch, glycogen, and cellulose. These three are referred to as <em class="emphasis">homopolymers</em> because each yields only one type of monosaccharide (glucose) after complete hydrolysis. <em class="emphasis">Heteropolymers</em> may contain sugar acids, amino sugars, or noncarbohydrate substances in addition to monosaccharides. Heteropolymers are common in nature (gums, pectins, and other substances) but will not be discussed further in this textbook. The polysaccharides are nonreducing carbohydrates, are not sweet tasting, and do not undergo mutarotation.</p>
    <div class="section" id="gob-ch16_s07_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Starch</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch16_s07_s01_p01">Starch is the most important source of carbohydrates in the human diet and accounts for more than 50% of our carbohydrate intake. It occurs in plants in the form of granules, and these are particularly abundant in seeds (especially the cereal grains) and tubers, where they serve as a storage form of carbohydrates. The breakdown of starch to glucose nourishes the plant during periods of reduced photosynthetic activity. We often think of potatoes as a “starchy” food, yet other plants contain a much greater percentage of starch (potatoes 15%, wheat 55%, corn 65%, and rice 75%). Commercial starch is a white powder.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch16_s07_s01_p02">Starch is a mixture of two polymers: <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">amylose</a><span class="glossdef">A linear polymer of glucose units found in starch.</span></span> and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">amylopectin</a><span class="glossdef">A branched polymer of glucose units found in starch.</span></span>. Natural starches consist of about 10%–30% amylase and 70%–90% amylopectin. Amylose is a linear polysaccharide composed entirely of D-glucose units joined by the α-1,4-glycosidic linkages we saw in maltose (part (a) of <a class="xref" href="#gob-ch16_s07_s01_f01">Figure 16.9 "Amylose"</a>). Experimental evidence indicates that amylose is not a straight chain of glucose units but instead is coiled like a spring, with six glucose monomers per turn (part (b) of <a class="xref" href="#gob-ch16_s07_s01_f01">Figure 16.9 "Amylose"</a>). When coiled in this fashion, amylose has just enough room in its core to accommodate an iodine molecule. The characteristic blue-violet color that appears when starch is treated with iodine is due to the formation of the amylose-iodine complex. This color test is sensitive enough to detect even minute amounts of starch in solution.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch16_s07_s01_p03">Amylopectin is a branched-chain polysaccharide composed of glucose units linked primarily by α-1,4-glycosidic bonds but with occasional α-1,6-glycosidic bonds, which are responsible for the branching. A molecule of amylopectin may contain many thousands of glucose units with branch points occurring about every 25–30 units (<a class="xref" href="#gob-ch16_s07_s01_f02">Figure 16.10 "Representation of the Branching in Amylopectin and Glycogen"</a>). The helical structure of amylopectin is disrupted by the branching of the chain, so instead of the deep blue-violet color amylose gives with iodine, amylopectin produces a less intense reddish brown.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch16_s07_s01_p04">Dextrins are glucose polysaccharides of intermediate size. The shine and stiffness imparted to clothing by starch are due to the presence of dextrins formed when clothing is ironed. Because of their characteristic stickiness with wetting, dextrins are used as adhesives on stamps, envelopes, and labels; as binders to hold pills and tablets together; and as pastes. Dextrins are more easily digested than starch and are therefore used extensively in the commercial preparation of infant foods.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Glycogen</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch16_s07_s02_p01">Glycogen is the energy reserve carbohydrate of animals. Practically all mammalian cells contain some stored carbohydrates in the form of glycogen, but it is especially abundant in the liver (4%–8% by weight of tissue) and in skeletal muscle cells (0.5%–1.0%). Like starch in plants, glycogen is found as granules in liver and muscle cells. When fasting, animals draw on these glycogen reserves during the first day without food to obtain the glucose needed to maintain metabolic balance.</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="gob-ch16_s07_s02_n01">
            <h3 class="title">Note</h3>
            <p class="para" id="gob-ch16_s07_s02_p02">About 70% of the total glycogen in the body is stored in muscle cells. Although the percentage of glycogen (by weight) is higher in the liver, the much greater mass of skeletal muscle stores a greater total amount of glycogen.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch16_s07_s02_p03">Glycogen is structurally quite similar to amylopectin, although glycogen is more highly branched (8–12 glucose units between branches) and the branches are shorter. When treated with iodine, glycogen gives a reddish brown color. Glycogen can be broken down into its D-glucose subunits by acid hydrolysis or by the same enzymes that catalyze the breakdown of starch. In animals, the enzyme phosphorylase catalyzes the breakdown of glycogen to phosphate esters of glucose.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Cellulose</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch16_s07_s03_p01">Cellulose, a fibrous carbohydrate found in all plants, is the structural component of plant cell walls. Because the earth is covered with vegetation, cellulose is the most abundant of all carbohydrates, accounting for over 50% of all the carbon found in the vegetable kingdom. Cotton fibrils and filter paper are almost entirely cellulose (about 95%), wood is about 50% cellulose, and the dry weight of leaves is about 10%–20% cellulose. The largest use of cellulose is in the manufacture of paper and paper products. Although the use of noncellulose synthetic fibers is increasing, rayon (made from cellulose) and cotton still account for over 70% of textile production.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch16_s07_s03_p02">Like amylose, cellulose is a linear polymer of glucose. It differs, however, in that the glucose units are joined by β-1,4-glycosidic linkages, producing a more extended structure than amylose (part (a) of <a class="xref" href="#gob-ch16_s07_s03_f01">Figure 16.11 "Cellulose"</a>). This extreme linearity allows a great deal of hydrogen bonding between OH groups on adjacent chains, causing them to pack closely into fibers (part (b) of <a class="xref" href="#gob-ch16_s07_s03_f01">Figure 16.11 "Cellulose"</a>). As a result, cellulose exhibits little interaction with water or any other solvent. Cotton and wood, for example, are completely insoluble in water and have considerable mechanical strength. Because cellulose does not have a helical structure, it does not bind to iodine to form a colored product.</p>

            <p class="para">(a) There is extensive hydrogen bonding in the structure of cellulose. (b) In this electron micrograph of the cell wall of an alga, the wall consists of successive layers of cellulose fibers in parallel arrangement.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch16_s07_s03_p03">Cellulose yields D-glucose after complete acid hydrolysis, yet humans are unable to metabolize cellulose as a source of glucose. Our digestive juices lack enzymes that can hydrolyze the β-glycosidic linkages found in cellulose, so although we can eat potatoes, we cannot eat grass. However, certain microorganisms can digest cellulose because they make the enzyme cellulase, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of cellulose. The presence of these microorganisms in the digestive tracts of herbivorous animals (such as cows, horses, and sheep) allows these animals to degrade the cellulose from plant material into glucose for energy. Termites also contain cellulase-secreting microorganisms and thus can subsist on a wood diet. This example once again demonstrates the extreme stereospecificity of biochemical processes.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Career Focus: Certified Diabetes Educator</h3>
            <p class="para" id="gob-ch16_s07_s03_p04">Certified diabetes educators come from a variety of health professions, such as nursing and dietetics, and specialize in the education and treatment of patients with diabetes. A diabetes educator will work with patients to manage their diabetes. This involves teaching the patient to monitor blood sugar levels, make good food choices, develop and maintain an exercise program, and take medication, if required. Diabetes educators also work with hospital or nursing home staff to improve the care of diabetic patients. Educators must be willing to spend time attending meetings and reading the current literature to maintain their knowledge of diabetes medications, nutrition, and blood monitoring devices so that they can pass this information to their patients.</p>

        <p class="para" id="gob-ch16_s08_p01"><em class="emphasis">To ensure that you understand the material in this chapter, you should review the meanings of the bold terms in the following summary and ask yourself how they relate to the topics in the chapter.</em></p>
        <p class="para" id="gob-ch16_s08_p02"><strong class="emphasis bold">Carbohydrates</strong>, a large group of biological compounds containing carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms, include sugars, starch, glycogen, and cellulose. All carbohydrates contain alcohol functional groups, and either an aldehyde or a ketone group (or a functional group that can be converted to an aldehyde or ketone). The simplest carbohydrates are <strong class="emphasis bold">monosaccharides</strong>. Those with two monosaccharide units are <strong class="emphasis bold">disaccharides</strong>, and those with many monosaccharide units are <strong class="emphasis bold">polysaccharides</strong>. Most sugars are either monosaccharides or disaccharides. Cellulose, glycogen, and starch are polysaccharides.</p>
        <p class="para" id="gob-ch16_s08_p03">Many carbohydrates exist as <strong class="emphasis bold">stereoisomers</strong>, in which the three-dimensional spatial arrangement of the atoms in space is the only difference between the isomers. These particular stereoisomers contain at least one <strong class="emphasis bold">chiral carbon</strong>, a carbon atom that has four different groups bonded to it. A molecule containing a chiral carbon is nonsuperimposable on its mirror image, and two molecules that are nonsuperimposable mirror images of each other are a special type of stereoisomer called <strong class="emphasis bold">enantiomers</strong>. Enantiomers have the same physical properties, such as melting point, but differ in the direction they rotate polarized light.</p>
        <p class="para" id="gob-ch16_s08_p04">A sugar is designated as being a D sugar or an L sugar according to how, in a Fischer projection of the molecule, the hydrogen atom and OH group are attached to the <em class="emphasis">penultimate</em> carbon atom, which is the carbon atom immediately before the terminal alcohol carbon atom. If the structure at this carbon atom is the same as that of D-glyceraldehyde (OH to the right), the sugar is a <strong class="emphasis bold">D sugar</strong>; if the configuration is the same as that of L-glyceraldehyde (OH to the left), the sugar is an <strong class="emphasis bold">L sugar</strong>.</p>
        <p class="para" id="gob-ch16_s08_p05">Monosaccharides of five or more carbons atoms readily form cyclic structures when the carbonyl carbon atom reacts with an OH group on a carbon atom three or four carbon atoms distant. Consequently, glucose in solution exists as an equilibrium mixture of three forms, two of them cyclic (α- and β-) and one open chain. In Haworth projections, the <em class="emphasis">alpha</em> form is drawn with the OH group on the “former” carbonyl carbon atom (<strong class="emphasis bold">anomeric carbon</strong>) pointing downward; the <em class="emphasis">beta</em> form, with the OH group pointing upward; these two compounds are stereoisomers and are given the more specific term of <strong class="emphasis bold">anomers</strong>. Any solid sugar can be all alpha or all beta. Once the sample is dissolved in water, however, the ring opens up into the open-chain structure and then closes to form either the α- or the β-anomer. These interconversions occur back and forth until a dynamic equilibrium mixture is achieved in a process called <strong class="emphasis bold">mutarotation</strong>.</p>
        <p class="para" id="gob-ch16_s08_p06">The carbonyl group present in monosaccharides is easily oxidized by Tollens’ or Benedict’s reagents (as well as others). Any mono- or disaccharide containing a free anomeric carbon is a <strong class="emphasis bold">reducing sugar</strong>. The disaccharide <em class="emphasis">maltose</em> contains two glucose units joined in an α-1,4-glycosidic linkage. The disaccharide <em class="emphasis">lactose</em> contains a galactose unit and a glucose unit joined by a β-1,4-glycosidic linkage. Both maltose and lactose contain a free anomeric carbon that can convert to an aldehyde functional group, so they are reducing sugars; they also undergo mutarotation. Many adults, and some children, have a deficiency of the enzyme lactase (which is needed to break down lactose) and are said to be <strong class="emphasis bold">lactose intolerant</strong>. A more serious problem is the genetic disease <strong class="emphasis bold">galactosemia</strong>, which results from the absence of an enzyme needed to convert galactose to glucose.</p>
        <p class="para" id="gob-ch16_s08_p07">The disaccharide <em class="emphasis">sucrose</em> (table sugar) consists of a glucose unit and a fructose unit joined by a glycosidic linkage. The linkage is designated as an α-1,β-2-glycosidic linkage because it involves the OH group on the first carbon atom of glucose and the OH group on the second carbon atom of fructose. Sucrose is not a reducing sugar because it has no anomeric carbon that can reform a carbonyl group, and it cannot undergo mutarotation because of the restrictions imposed by this linkage.</p>
        <p class="para" id="gob-ch16_s08_p08"><em class="emphasis">Starch</em>, the principal carbohydrate of plants, is composed of the polysaccharides <strong class="emphasis bold">amylose</strong> (10%–30%) and <strong class="emphasis bold">amylopectin</strong> (70%–90%). When ingested by humans and other animals, starch is hydrolyzed to glucose and becomes the body’s energy source. <em class="emphasis">Glycogen</em> is the polysaccharide animals use to store excess carbohydrates from their diets. Similar in structure to amylopectin, glycogen is hydrolyzed to glucose whenever an animal needs energy for a metabolic process. The polysaccharide <em class="emphasis">cellulose</em> provides structure for plant cells. It is a linear polymer of glucose units joined by β-1,4-glycosidic linkages. It is indigestible in the human body but digestible by many microorganisms, including microorganisms found in the digestive tracts of many herbivores.</p>
