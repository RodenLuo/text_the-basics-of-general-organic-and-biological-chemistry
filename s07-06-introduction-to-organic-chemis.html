In this section, we introduce organic chemistry more formally.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch04_s06_p02"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Organic chemistry</a><span class="glossdef">The study of the chemistry of carbon compounds.</span></span> is the study of the chemistry of carbon compounds. Carbon is singled out because it has a chemical diversity unrivaled by any other chemical element. Its diversity is based on the following:</p>

        <li>Carbon atoms bond reasonably strongly with other carbon atoms.</li>
        <li>Carbon atoms bond reasonably strongly with atoms of other elements.</li>
        <li>Carbon atoms make a large number of covalent bonds (four).</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch04_s06_p03">Curiously, elemental carbon is not particularly abundant. It does not even appear in the list of the most common elements in Earth’s crust. (See <a class="xref" href="gob-ch02_s01#gob-ch02_s01_s01_t01">Table 2.1 "Elemental Composition of Earth"</a> in <a class="xref" href="gob-ch02#gob-ch02">Chapter 2 "Elements, Atoms, and the Periodic Table"</a>.) Nevertheless, all living things consist of organic compounds.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch04_s06_p04">Most organic chemicals are covalent compounds, which is why we introduce organic chemistry here. By convention, compounds containing carbonate ions and bicarbonate ions, as well as carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide, are not considered part of organic chemistry, even though they contain carbon.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch04_s06_p05">The simplest organic compounds are the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">hydrocarbons</a><span class="glossdef">The simplest organic compound, composed of carbon and hydrogen atoms only.</span></span>, compounds composed of carbon and hydrogen atoms only. Some hydrocarbons have only single bonds and appear as a chain (which can be a straight chain or can have branches) of carbon atoms also bonded to hydrogen atoms. These hydrocarbons are called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">alkanes (saturated hydrocarbons)</a><span class="glossdef">A hydrocarbon with only single covalent bonds and existing as a chain of carbon atoms also bonded to hydrogen atoms.</span></span>. Each alkane has a characteristic, systematic name depending on the number of carbon atoms in the molecule. These names consist of a stem that indicates the number of carbon atoms in the chain plus the ending -<em class="emphasis">ane</em>. The stem <em class="emphasis">meth</em>- means one carbon atom, so methane is an alkane with one carbon atom. Similarly, the stem <em class="emphasis">eth</em>- means two carbon atoms; ethane is an alkane with two carbon atoms. Continuing, the stem <em class="emphasis">prop</em>- means three carbon atoms, so propane is an alkane with three carbon atoms. <a class="xref" href="#gob-ch04_s06_f01">Figure 4.6 "Formulas and Molecular Models of the Three Simplest Alkanes"</a> gives the formulas and the molecular models of the three simplest alkanes.

        <p class="para" id="gob-ch04_s06_p09">Hydrocarbons are not the only compounds that can have carbon–carbon double bonds. A group of compounds called fats can have them as well, and their presence or absence in the human diet is becoming increasingly correlated with health issues.</p>
        <p class="para" id="gob-ch04_s06_p10">Fats are combinations of long-chain organic compounds (fatty acids) and glycerol (C<sub class="subscript">3</sub>H<sub class="subscript">8</sub>O<sub class="subscript">3</sub>). (For more information on fats, see <a class="xref" href="gob-ch17#gob-ch17">Chapter 17 "Lipids"</a>, <a class="xref" href="gob-ch17_s01#gob-ch17_s01">Section 17.1 "Fatty Acids"</a>.) The long carbon chains can have either all single bonds, in which case the fat is classified as <em class="emphasis">saturated</em>, or one or more double bonds, in which case it is a <em class="emphasis">monounsaturated</em> or a <em class="emphasis">polyunsaturated</em> fat, respectively. Saturated fats are typically solids at room temperature; beef fat (tallow) is one example. Mono- or polyunsaturated fats are likely to be liquids at room temperature and are often called oils. Olive oil, flaxseed oil, and many fish oils are mono- or polyunsaturated fats.</p>
        <p class="para" id="gob-ch04_s06_p11">Studies have linked higher amounts of saturated fats in people’s diets with a greater likelihood of developing heart disease, high cholesterol, and other diet-related diseases. In contrast, increases in unsaturated fats (either mono- or polyunsaturated) have been linked to a lower incidence of certain diseases. Thus, there have been an increasing number of recommendations by government bodies and health associations to decrease the proportion of saturated fat and increase the proportion of unsaturated fat in the diet. Most of these organizations also recommend decreasing the total amount of fat in the diet.</p>
        <p class="para" id="gob-ch04_s06_p12">Recently, certain fats called trans fats have been implicated in the presence of heart disease. These are fats from animal sources and are also produced when liquid oils are exposed to partial hydrogenation, an industrial process that increases their saturation. Trans fats are used in many prepared and fried foods. Because they bring with them the health risks that naturally occurring saturated fats do, there has been some effort to better quantify the presence of trans fats in food products. US law now requires that food labels list the amount of trans fat in each serving.</p>
        <p class="para" id="gob-ch04_s06_p13">Since 1992, the US Department of Agriculture has been promoting a food pyramid that gives a simple, visual picture of how much of what kind of foods make up a good, balanced diet. It recommends eating as few fats as possible. Although nutritionists recognize that some fat is necessary (and largely unavoidable, even by strict vegetarians), they emphasize that a large proportion of any fat, saturated or unsaturated, in the diet is unhealthy. Even so, a difference as simple as the difference between a single and double carbon–carbon bond can have a significant impact on health.</p>

A functional group is a specific structural arrangement of atoms or bonds that imparts a characteristic chemical reactivity to a molecule. Alkanes have no functional group. A carbon–carbon double bond is considered a functional group because carbon–carbon double bonds chemically react in specific ways that differ from reactions of alkanes (for example, under certain circumstances, alkenes react with water); a carbon–carbon triple bond also undergoes certain specific chemical reactions. In the remainder of this section, we introduce two other common functional groups.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Career Focus: Forensic Chemist</h3>
        <p class="para" id="gob-ch04_s06_p26">The main job of a forensic chemist is to identify unknown materials and their origins. Although forensic chemists are most closely associated in the public mind with crime labs, they are employed in pursuits as diverse as tracing evolutionary patterns in living organisms, identifying environmental contaminants, and determining the origin of manufactured chemicals.</p>
        <p class="para" id="gob-ch04_s06_p27">In a crime lab, the forensic chemist has the job of identifying the evidence so that a crime can be solved. The unknown samples may consist of almost anything—for example, paint chips, blood, glass, cloth fibers, drugs, or human remains. The forensic chemist subjects them to a variety of chemical and instrumental tests to discover what the samples are. Sometimes these samples are extremely small, but sophisticated forensic labs have state-of-the-art equipment capable of identifying the smallest amount of unknown sample.</p>
        <p class="para" id="gob-ch04_s06_p28">Another aspect of a forensic chemist’s job is testifying in court. Judges and juries need to be informed about the results of forensic analyses, and it is the forensic chemist’s job to explain those results. Good public-speaking skills, along with a broad background in chemistry, are necessary to be a successful forensic chemist.</p>
