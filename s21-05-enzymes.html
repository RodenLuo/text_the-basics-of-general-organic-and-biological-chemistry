The reaction rates attained by enzymes are truly amazing. In their presence, reactions occur at rates that are a million (10<sup class="superscript">6</sup>) or more times faster than would be attainable in their absence. What is even more amazing is that enzymes perform this function at body temperature (~37°C) and physiological pH (pH ~7), rather than at the conditions that are typically necessary to increase reaction rates (high temperature or pressure, the use of strong oxidizing or reducing agents or strong acids or bases, or a combination of any of these). In addition, enzymes are highly specific in their action; that is, each enzyme catalyzes only one type of reaction in only one compound or a group of structurally related compounds. The compound or compounds on which an enzyme acts are known as its <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">substrates</a><span class="glossdef">A compound on which an enzyme acts.</span></span>.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch18_s05_p02">Hundreds of enzymes have been purified and studied in an effort to understand how they work so effectively and with such specificity. The resulting knowledge has been used to design drugs that inhibit or activate particular enzymes. An example is the intensive research to improve the treatment of or find a cure for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). AIDS is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Researchers are studying the enzymes produced by this virus and are developing drugs intended to block the action of those enzymes without interfering with enzymes produced by the human body. Several of these drugs have now been approved for use by AIDS patients.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch18_s05_p03">The first enzymes to be discovered were named according to their source or method of discovery. The enzyme <em class="emphasis">pepsin</em>, which aids in the hydrolysis of proteins, is found in the digestive juices of the stomach (Greek <em class="emphasis">pepsis</em>, meaning “digestion”). <em class="emphasis">Papain</em>, another enzyme that hydrolyzes protein (in fact, it is used in meat tenderizers), is isolated from papayas. As more enzymes were discovered, chemists recognized the need for a more systematic and chemically informative identification scheme.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch18_s05_p04">In the current numbering and naming scheme, under the oversight of the Nomenclature Commission of the International Union of Biochemistry, enzymes are arranged into six groups according to the general type of reaction they catalyze (<a class="xref" href="#gob-ch18_s05_t01">Table 18.5 "Classes of Enzymes"</a>), with subgroups and secondary subgroups that specify the reaction more precisely. Each enzyme is assigned a four-digit number, preceded by the prefix EC—for enzyme classification—that indicates its group, subgroup, and so forth. This is demonstrated in <a class="xref" href="#gob-ch18_s05_t02">Table 18.6 "Assignment of an Enzyme Classification Number"</a> for alcohol dehydrogenase. Each enzyme is also given a name consisting of the root of the name of its substrate or substrates and the -<em class="emphasis">ase</em> suffix. Thus urease is the enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea.</p>
