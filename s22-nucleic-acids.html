        <p class="para" id="gob-ch19_p01">Following the initial isolation of insulin in 1921, diabetic patients could be treated with insulin obtained from the pancreases of cattle and pigs. Unfortunately, some patients developed an allergic reaction to this insulin because its amino acid sequence was not identical to that of human insulin. In the 1970s, an intense research effort began that eventually led to the production of genetically engineered human insulin—the first genetically engineered product to be approved for medical use. To accomplish this feat, researchers first had to determine how insulin is made in the body and then find a way of causing the same process to occur in nonhuman organisms, such as bacteria or yeast cells. Many aspects of these discoveries are presented in this chapter on nucleic acids.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch19_p02">Dogs have puppies that grow up to be dogs. Foxes have kits that grow up to be foxes. From viruses to humans, each species reproduces after its own kind. Furthermore, within each multicellular organism, every tissue is composed of cells specific to that tissue. What accounts for this specificity at all levels of reproduction? How does a fertilized egg “know” that it should develop into a kangaroo and not a koala? What makes stomach cells produce gastric acid, whereas pancreatic cells produce insulin? The blueprint for the reproduction and the maintenance of each organism is found in the nuclei of its cells, concentrated in elongated, threadlike structures called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">chromosomes</a><span class="glossdef">An elongated, threadlike structure composed of protein and DNA that contains the genetic blueprint.</span></span>. These complex structures, consisting of DNA and proteins, contain the basic units of heredity, called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">genes</a><span class="glossdef">The basic unit of heredity.</span></span>. The number of chromosomes (and genes) varies with each species. Human body cells have 23 pairs of chromosomes having 20,000–40,000 different genes.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch19_p03">Sperm and egg cells contain only a single copy of each chromosome; that is, they contain only one member of each chromosome pair. Thus, in sexual reproduction, the entire complement of chromosomes is achieved only when an egg and sperm combine. A new individual receives half its hereditary material from each parent.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch19_p04">Calling the unit of heredity a “gene” merely gives it a name. But what really are genes and how is the information they contain expressed? One definition of a gene is that it is a segment of DNA that constitutes the code <em class="emphasis">for a specific polypeptide</em>. If genes are segments of DNA, we need to learn more about the structure and physiological function of DNA. We begin by looking at the small molecules needed to form DNA and RNA (ribonucleic acid)—the nucleotides.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch19_s02_s01_p03">Like proteins, nucleic acids have a primary structure that is defined as the sequence of their nucleotides. Unlike proteins, which have 20 different kinds of amino acids, there are only 4 different kinds of nucleotides in nucleic acids. For amino acid sequences in proteins, the convention is to write the amino acids in order starting with the N-terminal amino acid. In writing nucleotide sequences for nucleic acids, the convention is to write the nucleotides (usually using the one-letter abbreviations for the bases, shown in <a class="xref" href="#gob-ch19_s02_s01_f01">Figure 19.5 "Structure of a Segment of DNA"</a>) starting with the nucleotide having a free phosphate group, which is known as the 5′ end, and indicate the nucleotides in order. For DNA, a lowercase <em class="emphasis">d</em> is often written in front of the sequence to indicate that the monomers are deoxyribonucleotides. The final nucleotide has a free OH group on the 3′ carbon atom and is called the <em class="emphasis">3′ end</em>. The sequence of nucleotides in the DNA segment shown in <a class="xref" href="#gob-ch19_s02_s01_f01">Figure 19.5 "Structure of a Segment of DNA"</a> would be written 5′-dG-dT-dA-dC-3′, which is often further abbreviated to dGTAC or just GTAC.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Secondary Structure of DNA</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch19_s02_s02_p01">The three-dimensional structure of DNA was the subject of an intensive research effort in the late 1940s to early 1950s. Initial work revealed that the polymer had a regular repeating structure. In 1950, Erwin Chargaff of Columbia University showed that the molar amount of adenine (A) in DNA was always equal to that of thymine (T). Similarly, he showed that the molar amount of guanine (G) was the same as that of cytosine (C). Chargaff drew no conclusions from his work, but others soon did.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch19_s02_s02_p02">At Cambridge University in 1953, James D. Watson and Francis Crick announced that they had a model for the secondary structure of DNA. Using the information from Chargaff’s experiments (as well as other experiments) and data from the X ray studies of Rosalind Franklin (which involved sophisticated chemistry, physics, and mathematics), Watson and Crick worked with models that were not unlike a child’s construction set and finally concluded that DNA is composed of two nucleic acid chains running antiparallel to one another—that is, side-by-side with the 5′ end of one chain next to the 3′ end of the other. Moreover, as their model showed, the two chains are twisted to form a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">double helix</a><span class="glossdef">The secondary structure of DNA.</span></span>—a structure that can be compared to a spiral staircase, with the phosphate and sugar groups (the backbone of the nucleic acid polymer) representing the outside edges of the staircase. The purine and pyrimidine bases face the inside of the helix, with guanine always opposite cytosine and adenine always opposite thymine. These specific base pairs, referred to as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">complementary bases</a><span class="glossdef">Specific base pairings in the DNA double helix.</span></span>, are the steps, or treads, in our staircase analogy (<a class="xref" href="#gob-ch19_s02_s02_f01">Figure 19.6 "DNA Double Helix"</a>).</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch19_s02_s02_p03">The structure proposed by Watson and Crick provided clues to the mechanisms by which cells are able to divide into two identical, functioning daughter cells; how genetic data are passed to new generations; and even how proteins are built to required specifications. All these abilities depend on the pairing of complementary bases. <a class="xref" href="#gob-ch19_s02_s02_f02">Figure 19.7 "Complementary Base Pairing"</a> shows the two sets of base pairs and illustrates two things. First, a pyrimidine is paired with a purine in each case, so that the long dimensions of both pairs are identical (1.08 nm). If two pyrimidines were paired or two purines were paired, the two pyrimidines would take up less space than a purine and a pyrimidine, and the two purines would take up more space, as illustrated in <a class="xref" href="#gob-ch19_s02_s02_f03">Figure 19.8 "Difference in Widths of Possible Base Pairs"</a>. If these pairings were ever to occur, the structure of DNA would be like a staircase made with stairs of different widths. For the two strands of the double helix to fit neatly, a pyrimidine must always be paired with a purine. The second thing you should notice in <a class="xref" href="#gob-ch19_s02_s02_f02">Figure 19.7 "Complementary Base Pairing"</a> is that the correct pairing enables formation of three instances of hydrogen bonding between guanine and cytosine and two between adenine and thymine. The additive contribution of this hydrogen bonding imparts great stability to the DNA double helix.</p>

But how do the nucleic acids perform these functions? Three processes are required: (1) <em class="emphasis">replication</em>, in which new copies of DNA are made; (2) <em class="emphasis">transcription</em>, in which a segment of DNA is used to produce RNA; and (3) <em class="emphasis">translation</em>, in which the information in RNA is translated into a protein sequence. (For more information on protein sequences, see <a class="xref" href="gob-ch19_s04#gob-ch19_s04">Section 19.4 "Protein Synthesis and the Genetic Code"</a>.)</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Replication</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch19_s03_s01_p01">New cells are continuously forming in the body through the process of cell division. For this to happen, the DNA in a dividing cell must be copied in a process known as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">replication</a><span class="glossdef">The process in which the DNA in a dividing cell is copied.</span></span>. The complementary base pairing of the double helix provides a ready model for how genetic replication occurs. If the two chains of the double helix are pulled apart, disrupting the hydrogen bonding between base pairs, each chain can act as a <em class="emphasis">template</em>, or pattern, for the synthesis of a new complementary DNA chain.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch19_s03_s01_p02">The nucleus contains all the necessary enzymes, proteins, and nucleotides required for this synthesis. A short segment of DNA is “unzipped,” so that the two strands in the segment are separated to serve as templates for new DNA. DNA polymerase, an enzyme, recognizes each base in a template strand and matches it to the complementary base in a free nucleotide. The enzyme then catalyzes the formation of an ester bond between the 5′ phosphate group of the nucleotide and the 3′ OH end of the new, growing DNA chain. In this way, each strand of the original DNA molecule is used to produce a duplicate of its former partner (<a class="xref" href="#gob-ch19_s03_s01_f01">Figure 19.9 "A Schematic Diagram of DNA Replication"</a>). Whatever information was encoded in the original DNA double helix is now contained in each replicate helix. When the cell divides, each daughter cell gets one of these replicates and thus all of the information that was originally possessed by the parent cell.</p>

            <p class="para">DNA replication occurs by the sequential unzipping of segments of the double helix. Each new nucleotide is brought into position by DNA polymerase and is added to the growing strand by the formation of a phosphate ester bond. Thus, two double helixes form from one, and each consists of one old strand and one new strand, an outcome called <em class="emphasis">semiconservative replications</em>.

An organism’s DNA can be compared to a book containing directions for assembling a model airplane or for knitting a sweater. Letters of the alphabet are arranged into words, and these words direct the individual to perform certain operations with specific materials. If all the directions are followed correctly, a model airplane or sweater is produced.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch19_s03_s01_p08">In DNA, the particular sequences of nucleotides along the chains encode the directions for building an organism. Just as <em class="emphasis">saw</em> means one thing in English and <em class="emphasis">was</em> means another, the sequence of bases CGT means one thing, and TGC means something different. Although there are only four letters—the four nucleotides—in the genetic code of DNA, their sequencing along the DNA strands can vary so widely that information storage is essentially unlimited.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Transcription</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch19_s03_s02_p01">For the hereditary information in DNA to be useful, it must be “expressed,” that is, used to direct the growth and functioning of an organism. The first step in the processes that constitute DNA expression is the synthesis of RNA, by a template mechanism that is in many ways analogous to DNA replication. Because the RNA that is synthesized is a complementary copy of information contained in DNA, RNA synthesis is referred to as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">transcription</a><span class="glossdef">The process in which RNA is synthesized from a DNA template.</span></span>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch19_s03_s02_p02">There are three key differences between replication and transcription: (1) RNA molecules are much shorter than DNA molecules; only a portion of one DNA strand is copied or transcribed to make an RNA molecule. (2) RNA is built from ribonucleotides rather than deoxyribonucleotides. (3) The newly synthesized RNA strand does not remain associated with the DNA sequence it was transcribed from.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch19_s03_s02_p03">The DNA sequence that is transcribed to make RNA is called the <em class="emphasis">template strand</em>, while the complementary sequence on the other DNA strand is called the <em class="emphasis">coding</em> or <em class="emphasis">informational strand</em>. To initiate RNA synthesis, the two DNA strands unwind at specific sites along the DNA molecule. Ribonucleotides are attracted to the uncoiling region of the DNA molecule, beginning at the 3′ end of the template strand, according to the rules of base pairing. Thymine in DNA calls for adenine in RNA, cytosine specifies guanine, guanine calls for cytosine, and adenine requires uracil. RNA polymerase—an enzyme—binds the complementary ribonucleotide and catalyzes the formation of the ester linkage between ribonucleotides, a reaction very similar to that catalyzed by DNA polymerase (<a class="xref" href="#gob-ch19_s03_s02_f01">Figure 19.10 "A Schematic Diagram of RNA Transcription from a DNA Template"</a>). Synthesis of the RNA strand takes place in the 5′ to 3′ direction, antiparallel to the template strand. Only a short segment of the RNA molecule is hydrogen-bonded to the template strand at any time during transcription. When transcription is completed, the RNA is released, and the DNA helix reforms.

        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch19_s03_s02_p08">Three types of RNA are formed during transcription: <em class="emphasis">messenger RNA</em> (mRNA), <em class="emphasis">ribosomal RNA</em> (rRNA), and <em class="emphasis">transfer RNA</em> (tRNA). These three types of RNA differ in function, size, and percentage of the total cell RNA (<a class="xref" href="#gob-ch19_s03_s02_t01">Table 19.2 "Properties of Cellular RNA in "</a>). mRNA makes up only a small percent of the total amount of RNA within the cell, primarily because each molecule of mRNA exists for a relatively short time; it is continuously being degraded and resynthesized. The molecular dimensions of the mRNA molecule vary according to the amount of genetic information a given molecule contains. After transcription, which takes place in the nucleus, the mRNA passes into the cytoplasm, carrying the genetic message from DNA to the ribosomes, the sites of protein synthesis. In <a class="xref" href="gob-ch19_s05#gob-ch19_s05">Section 19.5 "Mutations and Genetic Diseases"</a>, we shall see how mRNA directly determines the sequence of amino acids during protein synthesis.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch19_s04_p01">One of the definitions of a gene is as follows: a segment of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) carrying the code for a specific polypeptide. Each molecule of messenger RNA (mRNA) is a transcribed copy of a gene that is used by a cell for synthesizing a polypeptide chain. If a protein contains two or more different polypeptide chains, each chain is coded by a different gene. We turn now to the question of how the sequence of nucleotides in a molecule of ribonucleic acid (RNA) is translated into an amino acid sequence.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch19_s04_p02">How can a molecule containing just 4 different nucleotides specify the sequence of the 20 amino acids that occur in proteins? If each nucleotide coded for 1 amino acid, then obviously the nucleic acids could code for only 4 amino acids. What if amino acids were coded for by groups of 2 nucleotides? There are 4<sup class="superscript">2</sup>, or 16, different combinations of 2 nucleotides (AA, AU, AC, AG, UU, and so on). Such a code is more extensive but still not adequate to code for 20 amino acids. However, if the nucleotides are arranged in groups of 3, the number of different possible combinations is 4<sup class="superscript">3</sup>, or 64. Here we have a code that is extensive enough to direct the synthesis of the primary structure of a protein molecule.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch19_s04_p03">The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">genetic code</a><span class="glossdef">The identification of each group of three nucleotides and its particular amino acid.</span></span> can therefore be described as <em class="emphasis">the identification of each group of three nucleotides and its particular amino acid</em>. The sequence of these triplet groups in the mRNA dictates the sequence of the amino acids in the protein. Each individual three-nucleotide coding unit, as we have seen, is called a <em class="emphasis">codon</em>.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch19_s04_p04">Protein synthesis is accomplished by orderly interactions between mRNA and the other ribonucleic acids (transfer RNA [tRNA] and ribosomal RNA [rRNA]), the ribosome, and more than 100 enzymes. The mRNA formed in the nucleus during transcription is transported across the nuclear membrane into the cytoplasm to the ribosomes—carrying with it the genetic instructions. The process in which the information encoded in the mRNA is used to direct the sequencing of amino acids and thus ultimately to synthesize a protein is referred to as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">translation</a><span class="glossdef">The process in which the information encoded in mRNA is used to direct the sequencing of amino acids to synthesize a protein.</span></span>.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch19_s04_p05">Before an amino acid can be incorporated into a polypeptide chain, it must be attached to its unique tRNA. This crucial process requires an enzyme known as aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (<a class="xref" href="#gob-ch19_s04_f01">Figure 19.12 "Binding of an Amino Acid to Its tRNA"</a>). There is a specific aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase for each amino acid. This high degree of specificity is vital to the incorporation of the correct amino acid into a protein. After the amino acid molecule has been bound to its tRNA carrier, protein synthesis can take place. <a class="xref" href="#gob-ch19_s04_f02">Figure 19.13 "The Elongation Steps in Protein Synthesis"</a> depicts a schematic stepwise representation of this all-important process.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch19_s04_p06">Early experimenters were faced with the task of determining which of the 64 possible codons stood for each of the 20 amino acids. The cracking of the genetic code was the joint accomplishment of several well-known geneticists—notably Har Khorana, Marshall Nirenberg, Philip Leder, and Severo Ochoa—from 1961 to 1964. The genetic dictionary they compiled, summarized in <a class="xref" href="#gob-ch19_s04_f03">Figure 19.14 "The Genetic Code"</a>, shows that 61 codons code for amino acids, and 3 codons serve as signals for the termination of polypeptide synthesis (much like the period at the end of a sentence). Notice that only methionine (AUG) and tryptophan (UGG) have single codons. All other amino acids have two or more codons.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch19_s04_p11">Further experimentation threw much light on the nature of the genetic code, as follows:</p>
    <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="gob-ch19_s04_l02">
        <li>The code is virtually universal; animal, plant, and bacterial cells use the same codons to specify each amino acid (with a few exceptions).</li>
        <li>The code is “degenerate”; in all but two cases (methionine and tryptophan), more than one triplet codes for a given amino acid.</li>
        <li>The first two bases of each codon are most significant; the third base often varies. This suggests that a change in the third base by a mutation may still permit the correct incorporation of a given amino acid into a protein. (For more information on mutations, see <a class="xref" href="gob-ch19_s05#gob-ch19_s05">Section 19.5 "Mutations and Genetic Diseases"</a>.) The third base is sometimes called the “wobble” base.</li>
        <li>The code is continuous and nonoverlapping; there are <em class="emphasis">no</em> nucleotides between codons, and adjacent codons do not overlap.</li>
        <li>The three termination codons are read by special proteins called release factors, which signal the end of the translation process.</li>
        <li>The codon AUG codes for methionine and is also the initiation codon. Thus methionine is the first amino acid in each newly synthesized polypeptide. This first amino acid is usually removed enzymatically before the polypeptide chain is completed; the vast majority of polypeptides do not begin with methionine.</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch19_s05_p01">We have seen that the sequence of nucleotides in a cell’s deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is what ultimately determines the sequence of amino acids in proteins made by the cell and thus is critical for the proper functioning of the cell. On rare occasions, however, the nucleotide sequence in DNA may be modified either spontaneously (by errors during replication, occurring approximately once for every 10 billion nucleotides) or from exposure to heat, radiation, or certain chemicals. Any chemical or physical change that alters the nucleotide sequence in DNA is called a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">mutation</a><span class="glossdef">Any chemical or physical change that alters the nucleotide sequence in DNA.</span></span>. When a mutation occurs in an egg or sperm cell that then produces a living organism, it will be inherited by all the offspring of that organism.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch19_s05_p02">Common types of mutations include <em class="emphasis">substitution</em> (a different nucleotide is substituted), <em class="emphasis">insertion</em> (the addition of a new nucleotide), and <em class="emphasis">deletion</em> (the loss of a nucleotide). These changes within DNA are called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">point mutations</a><span class="glossdef">A change in which one nucleotide is substituted, added, or deleted.</span></span> because only one nucleotide is substituted, added, or deleted (<a class="xref" href="#gob-ch19_s05_f01">Figure 19.15 "Three Types of Point Mutations"</a>). Because an insertion or deletion results in a frame-shift that changes the reading of subsequent codons and, therefore, alters the entire amino acid sequence that follows the mutation, insertions and deletions are usually more harmful than a substitution in which only a single amino acid is altered.</p>

For example, exposure to UV light can result in the formation of a covalent bond between two adjacent thymines on a DNA strand, producing a thymine dimer (<a class="xref" href="#gob-ch19_s05_f02">Figure 19.16 "An Example of Radiation Damage to DNA"</a>). If not repaired, the dimer prevents the formation of the double helix at the point where it occurs. The genetic disease <em class="emphasis">xeroderma pigmentosum</em> is caused by a lack of the enzyme that cuts out the thymine dimers in damaged DNA. Individuals affected by this condition are abnormally sensitive to light and are more prone to skin cancer than normal individuals.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch19_s05_p04">Sometimes gene mutations are beneficial, but most of them are detrimental. For example, if a point mutation occurs at a crucial position in a DNA sequence, the affected protein will lack biological activity, perhaps resulting in the death of a cell. In such cases the altered DNA sequence is lost and will not be copied into daughter cells. Nonlethal mutations in an egg or sperm cell may lead to metabolic abnormalities or hereditary diseases.

    <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch19_s05_p07">PKU may be diagnosed by assaying a sample of blood or urine for phenylalanine or one of its metabolites. Medical authorities recommend testing every newborn’s blood for phenylalanine within 24 h to 3 weeks after birth. If the condition is detected, mental retardation can be prevented by immediately placing the infant on a diet containing little or no phenylalanine. Because phenylalanine is plentiful in naturally produced proteins, the low-phenylalanine diet depends on a synthetic protein substitute plus very small measured amounts of naturally produced foods. Before dietary treatment was introduced in the early 1960s, severe mental retardation was a common outcome for children with PKU. Prior to the 1960s, 85% of patients with PKU had an intelligence quotient (IQ) less than 40, and 37% had IQ scores below 10. Since the introduction of dietary treatments, however, over 95% of children with PKU have developed normal or near-normal intelligence. The incidence of PKU in newborns is about 1 in 12,000 in North America.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch19_s05_p09">Several genetic diseases are collectively categorized as <em class="emphasis">lipid-storage diseases</em>. Lipids are constantly being synthesized and broken down in the body, so if the enzymes that catalyze lipid degradation are missing, the lipids tend to accumulate and cause a variety of medical problems. When a genetic mutation occurs in the gene for the enzyme hexosaminidase A, for example, gangliosides cannot be degraded but accumulate in brain tissue, causing the ganglion cells of the brain to become greatly enlarged and nonfunctional. (For more information on gangliosides, see <a class="xref" href="gob-ch17#gob-ch17">Chapter 17 "Lipids"</a>, <a class="xref" href="gob-ch17_s03#gob-ch17_s03">Section 17.3 "Membranes and Membrane Lipids"</a>.) This genetic disease, known as <em class="emphasis">Tay-Sachs disease</em>, leads to a regression in development, dementia, paralysis, and blindness, with death usually occurring before the age of three. There is currently no treatment, but Tay-Sachs disease can be diagnosed in a fetus by assaying the amniotic fluid (amniocentesis) for hexosaminidase A. A blood test can identify Tay-Sachs carriers—people who inherit a defective gene from only one rather than both parents—because they produce only half the normal amount of hexosaminidase A, although they do not exhibit symptoms of the disease.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Looking Closer: Recombinant DNA Technology</h3>
        <p class="para" id="gob-ch19_s05_p10">More than 3,000 human diseases have been shown to have a genetic component, caused or in some way modulated by the person’s genetic composition. Moreover, in the last decade or so, researchers have succeeded in identifying many of the genes and even mutations that are responsible for specific genetic diseases. Now scientists have found ways of identifying and isolating genes that have specific biological functions and placing those genes in another organism, such as a bacterium, which can be easily grown in culture. With these techniques, known as <em class="emphasis">recombinant DNA technology</em>, the ability to cure many serious genetic diseases appears to be within our grasp.</p>
        <p class="para" id="gob-ch19_s05_p11">Isolating the specific gene or genes that cause a particular genetic disease is a monumental task. One reason for the difficulty is the enormous amount of a cell’s DNA, only a minute portion of which contains the gene sequence. Thus, the first task is to obtain smaller pieces of DNA that can be more easily handled. Fortunately, researchers are able to use <em class="emphasis">restriction enzymes</em> (also known as restriction endonucleases), discovered in 1970, which are enzymes that cut DNA at specific, known nucleotide sequences, yielding DNA fragments of shorter length. For example, the restriction enzyme <em class="emphasis">EcoRI</em> recognizes the nucleotide sequence shown here and cuts both DNA strands as indicated:</p>
        <div class="informalfigure large">
            <img src="section_22/51cd362033b2ba4b399e8947ae636805.jpg">
        </div>
        <p class="para" id="gob-ch19_s05_p12">Once a DNA strand has been fragmented, it must be cloned; that is, multiple identical copies of each DNA fragment are produced to make sure there are sufficient amounts of each to detect and manipulate in the laboratory. Cloning is accomplished by inserting the individual DNA fragments into phages (bacterial viruses) that can enter bacterial cells and be replicated. When a bacterial cell infected by the modified phage is placed in an appropriate culture medium, it forms a colony of cells, all containing copies of the original DNA fragment. This technique is used to produce many bacterial colonies, each containing a different DNA fragment. The result is a <em class="emphasis">DNA library</em>, a collection of bacterial colonies that together contain the entire genome of a particular organism.</p>
        <p class="para" id="gob-ch19_s05_p13">The next task is to screen the DNA library to determine which bacterial colony (or colonies) has incorporated the DNA fragment containing the desired gene. A short piece of DNA, known as a <em class="emphasis">hybridization probe</em>, which has a nucleotide sequence complementary to a known sequence in the gene, is synthesized, and a radioactive phosphate group is added to it as a “tag.” You might be wondering how researchers are able to prepare such a probe if the gene has not yet been isolated. One way is to use a segment of the desired gene isolated from another organism. An alternative method depends on knowing all or part of the amino acid sequence of the protein produced by the gene of interest: the amino acid sequence is used to produce an approximate genetic code for the gene, and this nucleotide sequence is then produced synthetically. (The amino acid sequence used is carefully chosen to include, if possible, many amino acids such as methionine and tryptophan, which have only a single codon each.)</p>
        <p class="para" id="gob-ch19_s05_p14">After a probe identifies a colony containing the desired gene, the DNA fragment is clipped out, again using restriction enzymes, and spliced into another replicating entity, usually a plasmid. <em class="emphasis">Plasmids</em> are tiny mini-chromosomes found in many bacteria, such as <em class="emphasis">Escherichia coli</em> (<em class="emphasis">E. coli</em>). A recombined plasmid would then be inserted into the host organism (usually the bacterium <em class="emphasis">E. coli</em>), where it would go to work to produce the desired protein.</p>

        <p class="para" id="gob-ch19_s05_p15">Proponents of recombinant DNA research are excited about its great potential benefits. An example is the production of human growth hormone, which is used to treat children who fail to grow properly. Formerly, human growth hormone was available only in tiny amounts obtained from cadavers. Now it is readily available through recombinant DNA technology. Another gene that has been cloned is the gene for epidermal growth factor, which stimulates the growth of skin cells and can be used to speed the healing of burns and other skin wounds. Recombinant techniques are also a powerful research tool, providing enormous aid to scientists as they map and sequence genes and determine the functions of different segments of an organism’s DNA.</p>
        <p class="para" id="gob-ch19_s05_p16">In addition to advancements in the ongoing treatment of genetic diseases, recombinant DNA technology may actually lead to cures. When appropriate genes are successfully inserted into <em class="emphasis">E. coli</em>, the bacteria can become miniature pharmaceutical factories, producing great quantities of insulin for people with diabetes, clotting factor for people with hemophilia, missing enzymes, hormones, vitamins, antibodies, vaccines, and so on. Recent accomplishments include the production in <em class="emphasis">E. coli</em> of recombinant DNA molecules containing synthetic genes for tissue plasminogen activator, a clot-dissolving enzyme that can rescue heart attack victims, as well as the production of vaccines against hepatitis B (humans) and hoof-and-mouth disease (cattle).</p>
        <p class="para" id="gob-ch19_s05_p17">Scientists have used other bacteria besides <em class="emphasis">E. coli</em> in gene-splicing experiments and also yeast and fungi. Plant molecular biologists use a bacterial plasmid to introduce genes for several foreign proteins (including animal proteins) into plants. The bacterium is <em class="emphasis">Agrobacterium tumefaciens</em>, which can cause tumors in many plants but which can be treated so that its tumor-causing ability is eliminated. One practical application of its plasmids would be to enhance a plant’s nutritional value by transferring into it the gene necessary for the synthesis of an amino acid in which the plant is normally deficient (for example, transferring the gene for methionine synthesis into pinto beans, which normally do not synthesize high levels of methionine).</p>

The shell consists of layers of one or more proteins and may also have lipid or carbohydrate molecules on the surface. Because of their simplicity, viruses must invade the cells of other organisms to be able to reproduce.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch19_s06_p02">Viruses are visible only under an electron microscope. They come in a variety of shapes, ranging from spherical to rod shaped. The fact that they contain either deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or ribonucleic acid (RNA)—<em class="emphasis">but never both</em>—allows them to be divided into two major classes: DNA viruses and RNA viruses (<a class="xref" href="#gob-ch19_s06_f01">Figure 19.17 "Viruses"</a>).</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch19_s06_p03">A <em class="emphasis">DNA virus</em> enters a host cell and induces the cell to replicate the viral DNA and produce viral proteins. These proteins and DNA assemble into new viruses that are released by the host cell, which may die in the process. The new viruses can then invade other cells and repeat the cycle. Cell death and the production of new viruses account for the symptoms of viral infections.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch19_s06_p04">Most <em class="emphasis">RNA viruses</em> use their nucleic acids in much the same way as the DNA viruses, penetrating a host cell and inducing it to replicate the viral RNA and synthesize viral proteins. The new RNA strands and viral proteins are then assembled into new viruses.

(See <a class="xref" href="gob-ch19_s03#gob-ch19_s03_s02_f01">Figure 19.10 "A Schematic Diagram of RNA Transcription from a DNA Template"</a> for the transcription process.)

    <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch19_s06_p05">Perhaps the best-known retrovirus is the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS. It is estimated that there are about 33 million people worldwide testing positive for HIV infections, many of whom have developed AIDS as a result. In 2007 alone, 2.7 million people became infected with HIV, and in the same year, AIDS caused the deaths of approximately 2 million people. The virus uses glycoproteins on its outer surface to attach to receptors on the surface of T cells, a group of white blood cells that normally help protect the body from infections. The virus then enters the T cell, where it replicates and eventually destroys the cell. With his or her T cells destroyed, the AIDS victim is at increased risk of succumbing to pneumonia or other infectious diseases.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch19_s06_p06">In 1987, azidothymidine (AZT, also known as zidovudine or the brand name Retrovir) became the first drug approved for the treatment of AIDS. It works by binding to reverse transcriptase in place of deoxythymidine triphosphate, after which, because AZT does not have a 3′OH group, further replication is blocked. In the past 10 years, several other drugs have been approved that also act by inhibiting the viral reverse transcriptase.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch19_s06_p07">As part of HIV reproduction in an infected cell, newly synthesized viral proteins must be cut by a specific viral-induced HIV protease to form shorter proteins. An intensive research effort was made to design drugs that specifically inhibited this proteolytic enzyme, without affecting the proteolytic enzymes (like trypsin) that are needed by the host. In December 1995, saquinavir (brand names Invirase and Fortovase) was approved for the treatment of AIDS. This drug represented a new class of drugs known as protease inhibitors. Other protease inhibitors soon gained Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval: ritonavir (Norvir), indinavir (Crixivan), and nelfinavir (Viracept).</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch19_s06_p08">Raltegravir (Isentress) is a newer anti-AIDS drug that was approved by the FDA in October 2007. This drug inhibits the integrase enzyme that is needed to integrate the HIV DNA into cellular DNA, an essential step in the production of more HIV particles.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch19_s06_p09">A major problem in treating HIV infections is that the virus can become resistant to any of these drugs. One way to combat the problem has been to administer a “cocktail” of drugs, typically a combination of two reverse transcriptase inhibitors along with a protease inhibitor. These treatments can significantly reduce the amount of HIV in an infected person.</p>

A genetics counselor may work in a variety of health-care settings (such as a hospital) to obtain family medical and reproductive histories; explain how genetic conditions are inherited; explain the causes, diagnosis, and care of these conditions; interpret the results of genetic tests; and aid the individual or family in making decisions regarding genetic diseases or conditions. A certified genetics counselor must obtain a master’s degree from an accredited program. Applicants to these graduate programs usually have an undergraduate degree in biology, psychology, or genetics.</p>

DNA contains the nitrogenous bases adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine, while the bases in RNA are adenine, cytosine, guanine, and uracil. The sugar in the nucleotides of RNA is ribose; the one in DNA is 2-deoxyribose. The sequence of nucleotides in a nucleic acid defines the primary structure of the molecule.</p>

The double helix uncoils, and ribonucleotides base-pair to the deoxyribonucleotides on one DNA strand; however, RNA is produced using <em class="emphasis">uracil</em> rather than thymine. Once the RNA is formed, it dissociates from the template and leaves the nucleus, and the DNA double helix reforms.</p>
        <p class="para" id="gob-ch19_s07_p06"><strong class="emphasis bold">Translation</strong> is the process in which proteins are synthesized from the information in mRNA. It occurs at structures called <strong class="emphasis bold">ribosomes</strong>, which are located outside the nucleus and are composed of rRNA and protein. The 64 possible three-nucleotide combinations of the 4 nucleotides of DNA constitute the <strong class="emphasis bold">genetic code</strong> that dictates the sequence in which amino acids are joined to make proteins. Each three-nucleotide sequence on mRNA is a <strong class="emphasis bold">codon</strong>. Each kind of tRNA molecule binds a specific amino acid and has a site containing a three-nucleotide sequence called an <strong class="emphasis bold">anticodon</strong>.</p>
        <p class="para" id="gob-ch19_s07_p07">The general term for any change in the genetic code in an organism’s DNA is <strong class="emphasis bold">mutation</strong>. A change in which a single base is substituted, inserted, or deleted is a <strong class="emphasis bold">point mutation</strong>. The chemical and/or physical agents that cause mutations are called <strong class="emphasis bold">mutagens</strong>. Diseases that occur due to mutations in critical DNA sequences are referred to as <strong class="emphasis bold">genetic diseases</strong>.</p>
        <p class="para" id="gob-ch19_s07_p08"><strong class="emphasis bold">Viruses</strong> are infectious agents composed of a tightly packed central core of nucleic acids enclosed by a protective shell of proteins. Viruses contain either DNA or RNA as their genetic material but not both. Some RNA viruses, called <strong class="emphasis bold">retroviruses</strong>, synthesize DNA in the host cell from their RNA genome. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</p>
