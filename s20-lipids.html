        <p class="para" id="gob-ch17_p01">On July 11, 2003, the Food and Drug Administration amended its food labeling regulations to require that manufacturers list the amount of <em class="emphasis">trans</em> fatty acids on Nutrition Facts labels of foods and dietary supplements, effective January 1, 2006. This amendment was a response to published studies demonstrating a link between the consumption of <em class="emphasis">trans</em> fatty acids and an increased risk of heart disease. <em class="emphasis">Trans</em> fatty acids are produced in the conversion of liquid oils to solid fats, as in the creation of many commercial margarines and shortenings. They have been shown to increase the levels of low-density lipoproteins (LDLs)—complexes that are often referred to as bad cholesterol—in the blood. In this chapter, you will learn about fatty acids and what is meant by a <em class="emphasis">trans</em> fatty acid, as well as the difference between fats and oils. You will also learn what cholesterol is and why it is an important molecule in the human body.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch17_p02">Fats and oils, found in many of the foods we eat, belong to a class of biomolecules known as lipids. Gram for gram, they pack more than twice the caloric content of carbohydrates: the oxidation of fats and oils supplies about 9 kcal of energy for every gram oxidized, whereas the oxidation of carbohydrates supplies only 4 kcal/g. Although the high caloric content of fats may be bad news for the dieter, it says something about the efficiency of nature’s designs. Our bodies use carbohydrates, primarily in the form of glucose, for our <em class="emphasis">immediate</em> energy needs. Our capacity for storing carbohydrates for later use is limited to tucking away a bit of glycogen in the liver or in muscle tissue. We store our <em class="emphasis">reserve</em> energy in lipid form, which requires far less space than the same amount of energy stored in carbohydrate form.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch17_p03">Lipids have other biological functions besides energy storage. They are a major component of the membranes of the 10 trillion cells in our bodies. They serve as protective padding and insulation for vital organs. Furthermore, without lipids in our diets, we would be deficient in the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch17_p04">Lipids are not defined by the presence of specific functional groups, as carbohydrates are, but by a physical property—solubility. Compounds isolated from body tissues are classified as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">lipids</a><span class="glossdef">A compound isolated from body tissues that is more soluble in organic solvents than in water.</span></span> if they are more soluble in organic solvents, such as dichloromethane, than in water. By this criterion, the lipid category includes not only fats and oils, which are esters of the trihydroxy alcohol glycerol and fatty acids, but also compounds that incorporate functional groups derived from phosphoric acid, carbohydrates, or amino alcohols, as well as steroid compounds such as cholesterol. (<a class="xref" href="#gob-ch17_f01">Figure 17.1 "Lipid Organization Based on Structural Relationships"</a> presents one scheme for classifying the various kinds of lipids.) We will discuss the various kinds of lipids by considering one subclass at a time and pointing out structural similarities and differences as we go.</p>

Both substances are required for normal growth and development, but the human body does not synthesize them. The body uses linoleic acid to synthesize many of the other unsaturated fatty acids, such as arachidonic acid, a precursor for the synthesis of prostaglandins. In addition, the essential fatty acids are necessary for the efficient transport and metabolism of cholesterol. The average daily diet should contain about 4–6 g of the essential fatty acids.</p>

        <h3 class="title">To Your Health: Prostaglandins</h3>
        <p class="para" id="gob-ch17_s01_p03">Prostaglandins are chemical messengers synthesized in the cells in which their physiological activity is expressed. They are unsaturated fatty acids containing 20 carbon atoms and are synthesized from arachidonic acid—a polyunsaturated fatty acid—when needed by a particular cell. They are called <em class="emphasis">prostaglandins</em> because they were originally isolated from semen found in the prostate gland. It is now known that they are synthesized in nearly all mammalian tissues and affect almost all organs in the body. The five major classes of prostaglandins are designated as PGA, PGB, PGE, PGF, and PGI. Subscripts are attached at the end of these abbreviations to denote the number of double bonds outside the five-carbon ring in a given prostaglandin.</p>
        <p class="para" id="gob-ch17_s01_p04">The prostaglandins are among the most potent biological substances known. Slight structural differences give them highly distinct biological effects; however, all prostaglandins exhibit some ability to induce smooth muscle contraction, lower blood pressure, and contribute to the inflammatory response. Aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, such as ibuprofen, obstruct the synthesis of prostaglandins by inhibiting cyclooxygenase, the enzyme needed for the initial step in the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins.</p>
        <p class="para" id="gob-ch17_s01_p05">Their wide range of physiological activity has led to the synthesis of hundreds of prostaglandins and their analogs. Derivatives of PGE<sub class="subscript">2</sub> are now used in the United States to induce labor. Other prostaglandins have been employed clinically to lower or increase blood pressure, inhibit stomach secretions, relieve nasal congestion, relieve asthma, and prevent the formation of blood clots, which are associated with heart attacks and strokes.</p>

Viewed as a whole, however, the saturated fatty acid molecule is relatively straight (part (b) of <a class="xref" href="#gob-ch17_s01_f01">Figure 17.2 "The Structure of Saturated Fatty Acids"</a>). Such molecules pack closely together into a crystal lattice, maximizing the strength of dispersion forces and causing fatty acids and the fats derived from them to have relatively high melting points. In contrast, each <em class="emphasis">cis</em> carbon-to-carbon double bond in an unsaturated fatty acid produces a pronounced bend in the molecule, so that these molecules do not stack neatly. As a result, the intermolecular attractions of unsaturated fatty acids (and unsaturated fats) are weaker, causing these substances to have lower melting points. Most are liquids at room temperature.</p>

Most natural waxes are mixtures of such esters. Plant waxes on the surfaces of leaves, stems, flowers, and fruits protect the plant from dehydration and invasion by harmful microorganisms. Carnauba wax, used extensively in floor waxes, automobile waxes, and furniture polish, is largely myricyl cerotate, obtained from the leaves of certain Brazilian palm trees. Animals also produce waxes that serve as protective coatings, keeping the surfaces of feathers, skin, and hair pliable and water repellent. In fact, if the waxy coating on the feathers of a water bird is dissolved as a result of the bird swimming in an oil slick, the feathers become wet and heavy, and the bird, unable to maintain its buoyancy, drowns.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch17_s02_s01_p02">If all three OH groups on the glycerol molecule are esterified with the same fatty acid, the resulting ester is called a <em class="emphasis">simple triglyceride</em>. Although simple triglycerides have been synthesized in the laboratory, they rarely occur in nature. Instead, a typical triglyceride obtained from naturally occurring fats and oils contains two or three different fatty acid components and is thus termed a <em class="emphasis">mixed triglyceride</em>.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch17_s02_s01_p03">A triglyceride is called a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">fat</a><span class="glossdef">A compound composed of large hydrocarbon chains that supplies energy for the body. It is a triglyceride that is a solid at room temperature.</span></span> if it is a solid at 25°C; it is called an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">oil</a><span class="glossdef">A triglyceride that is a liquid at room temperature.</span></span> if it is a liquid at that temperature. These differences in melting points reflect differences in the degree of unsaturation and number of carbon atoms in the constituent fatty acids. Triglycerides obtained from animal sources are usually solids, while those of plant origin are generally oils. Therefore, we commonly speak of animal fats and vegetable oils.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch17_s02_s01_p04">No single formula can be written to represent the naturally occurring fats and oils because they are highly complex mixtures of triglycerides in which many different fatty acids are represented. <a class="xref" href="#gob-ch17_s02_s01_t01">Table 17.2 "Average Fatty Acid Composition of Some Common Fats and Oils (%)*"</a> shows the fatty acid compositions of some common fats and oils. The composition of any given fat or oil can vary depending on the plant or animal species it comes from as well as on dietetic and climatic factors. To cite just one example, lard from corn-fed hogs is more highly saturated than lard from peanut-fed hogs. Palmitic acid is the most abundant of the saturated fatty acids, while oleic acid is the most abundant unsaturated fatty acid.</p>

The hydrolysis of fats and oils in the presence of a base is used to make soap and is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">saponification</a><span class="glossdef">The hydrolysis of fats and oils in the presence of a base to make soap.</span></span>.

            <p class="para" id="gob-ch17_s02_s03_p02">Ordinary soap is a mixture of the sodium salts of various fatty acids, produced in one of the oldest organic syntheses practiced by humans (second only to the fermentation of sugars to produce ethyl alcohol). Both the Phoenicians (600 BCE) and the Romans made soap from animal fat and wood ash. Even so, the widespread production of soap did not begin until the 1700s. Soap was traditionally made by treating molten lard or tallow with a slight excess of alkali in large open vats. The mixture was heated, and steam was bubbled through it. After saponification was completed, the soap was precipitated from the mixture by the addition of sodium chloride (NaCl), removed by filtration, and washed several times with water. It was then dissolved in water and reprecipitated by the addition of more NaCl. The glycerol produced in the reaction was also recovered from the aqueous wash solutions.</p>
            <p class="para" id="gob-ch17_s02_s03_p03">Pumice or sand is added to produce scouring soap, while ingredients such as perfumes or dyes are added to produce fragrant, colored soaps. Blowing air through molten soap produces a floating soap. Soft soaps, made with potassium salts, are more expensive but produce a finer lather and are more soluble. They are used in liquid soaps, shampoos, and shaving creams.</p>
            <p class="para" id="gob-ch17_s02_s03_p04">Dirt and grime usually adhere to skin, clothing, and other surfaces by combining with body oils, cooking fats, lubricating greases, and similar substances that act like glues. Because these substances are not miscible in water, washing with water alone does little to remove them. Soap removes them, however, because soap molecules have a dual nature. One end, called the <em class="emphasis">head</em>, carries an ionic charge (a carboxylate anion) and therefore dissolves in water; the other end, the <em class="emphasis">tail</em>, has a hydrocarbon structure and dissolves in oils. The hydrocarbon tails dissolve in the soil; the ionic heads remain in the aqueous phase, and the soap breaks the oil into tiny soap-enclosed droplets called <em class="emphasis">micelles</em>, which disperse throughout the solution. (For more information about cell structure, see <a class="xref" href="gob-ch17_s03#gob-ch17_s03">Section 17.3 "Membranes and Membrane Lipids"</a>.) The droplets repel each other because of their charged surfaces and do not coalesce. With the oil no longer “gluing” the dirt to the soiled surface (skin, cloth, dish), the soap-enclosed dirt can easily be rinsed away.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch17_s02_s03_p05">The double bonds in fats and oils can undergo hydrogenation and also oxidation. The hydrogenation of vegetable oils to produce semisolid fats is an important process in the food industry. Chemically, it is essentially identical to the catalytic hydrogenation reaction described for alkenes in <a class="xref" href="gob-ch13#gob-ch13">Chapter 13 "Unsaturated and Aromatic Hydrocarbons"</a>, <a class="xref" href="gob-ch13_s04#gob-ch13_s04">Section 13.4 "Chemical Properties of Alkenes"</a>.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch17_s02_s03_p06">In commercial processes, the number of double bonds that are hydrogenated is carefully controlled to produce fats with the desired consistency (soft and pliable). Inexpensive and abundant vegetable oils (canola, corn, soybean) are thus transformed into margarine and cooking fats. In the preparation of margarine, for example, partially hydrogenated oils are mixed with water, salt, and nonfat dry milk, along with flavoring agents, coloring agents, and vitamins A and D, which are added to approximate the look, taste, and nutrition of butter. (Preservatives and antioxidants are also added.) In most commercial peanut butter, the peanut oil has been partially hydrogenated to prevent it from separating out. Consumers could decrease the amount of saturated fat in their diet by using the original unprocessed oils on their foods, but most people would rather spread margarine on their toast than pour oil on it.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch17_s02_s03_p07">Many people have switched from butter to margarine or vegetable shortening because of concerns that saturated animal fats can raise blood cholesterol levels and result in clogged arteries. However, during the hydrogenation of vegetable oils, an isomerization reaction occurs that produces the <em class="emphasis">trans</em> fatty acids mentioned in the opening essay. However, studies have shown that <em class="emphasis">trans</em> fatty acids also raise cholesterol levels and increase the incidence of heart disease. <em class="emphasis">Trans</em> fatty acids do not have the bend in their structures, which occurs in <em class="emphasis">cis</em> fatty acids and thus pack closely together in the same way that the saturated fatty acids do. Consumers are now being advised to use polyunsaturated oils and soft or liquid margarine and reduce their total fat consumption to less than 30% of their total calorie intake each day.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch17_s02_s03_p08">Fats and oils that are in contact with moist air at room temperature eventually undergo oxidation and hydrolysis reactions that cause them to turn rancid, acquiring a characteristic disagreeable odor. One cause of the odor is the release of volatile fatty acids by hydrolysis of the ester bonds. Butter, for example, releases foul-smelling butyric, caprylic, and capric acids. Microorganisms present in the air furnish lipases that catalyze this process. Hydrolytic rancidity can easily be prevented by covering the fat or oil and keeping it in a refrigerator.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch17_s02_s03_p09">Another cause of volatile, odorous compounds is the oxidation of the unsaturated fatty acid components, particularly the readily oxidized structural unit</p>

Antioxidants are compounds whose affinity for oxygen is greater than that of the lipids in the food; thus they function by preferentially depleting the supply of oxygen absorbed into the product. Because vitamin E has antioxidant properties, it helps reduce damage to lipids in the body, particularly to unsaturated fatty acids found in cell membrane lipids.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch17_s04_s01_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Cholesterol</a><span class="glossdef">A steroid that is found in mammals.</span></span> (part (b) of <a class="xref" href="#gob-ch17_s04_f01">Figure 17.11 "Steroids"</a>) does not occur in plants, but it is the most abundant steroid in the human body (240 g is a typical amount). Excess cholesterol is believed to be a primary factor in the development of atherosclerosis and heart disease, which are major health problems in the United States today. About half of the body’s cholesterol is interspersed in the lipid bilayer of cell membranes (<a class="xref" href="gob-ch17_s03#gob-ch17_s03_f04">Figure 17.6 "Schematic Diagram of a Cell Membrane"</a>). Much of the rest is converted to cholic acid, which is used in the formation of bile salts. Cholesterol is also a precursor in the synthesis of sex hormones, adrenal hormones, and vitamin D. Excess cholesterol not metabolized by the body is released from the liver and transported by the blood to the gallbladder. Normally, it stays in solution there until being secreted into the intestine (as a component of bile) to be eliminated. Sometimes, however, cholesterol in the gallbladder precipitates in the form of gallstones. Indeed, the name <em class="emphasis">cholesterol</em> is derived from the Greek <em class="emphasis">chole</em>, meaning “bile,” and <em class="emphasis">stereos</em>, meaning “solid.”</p>

            <h3 class="title">To Your Health: Cholesterol and Heart Disease</h3>
            <p class="para" id="gob-ch17_s04_s01_p02">Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States for both men and women. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that heart disease claimed 631,636 lives in the United States (26% of all reported deaths) in 2006.</p>
            <p class="para" id="gob-ch17_s04_s01_p03">Scientists agree that elevated cholesterol levels in the blood, as well as high blood pressure, obesity, diabetes, and cigarette smoking, are associated with an increased risk of heart disease. A long-term investigation by the National Institutes of Health showed that among men ages 30 to 49, the incidence of heart disease was five times greater for those whose cholesterol levels were above 260 mg/100 mL of serum than for those with cholesterol levels of 200 mg/100 mL or less. The cholesterol content of blood varies considerably with age, diet, and sex. Young adults average about 170 mg of cholesterol per 100 mL of blood, whereas males at age 55 may have cholesterol levels at 250 mg/100 mL or higher because the rate of cholesterol breakdown decreases with age. Females tend to have lower blood cholesterol levels than males.</p>
            <p class="para" id="gob-ch17_s04_s01_p04">To understand the link between heart disease and cholesterol levels, it is important to understand how cholesterol and other lipids are transported in the body. Lipids, such as cholesterol, are not soluble in water and therefore cannot be transported in the blood (an aqueous medium) unless they are complexed with proteins that are soluble in water, forming assemblages called <em class="emphasis">lipoproteins</em>. Lipoproteins are classified according to their density, which is dependent on the relative amounts of protein and lipid they contain. Lipids are less dense than proteins, so lipoproteins containing a greater proportion of lipid are less dense than those containing a greater proportion of protein.</p>
            <div class="informalfigure large">
                <img src="section_20/0df857122112b86bb39e1519eb4aa8cd.jpg">
            </div>
            <p class="para" id="gob-ch17_s04_s01_p05">Research on cholesterol and its role in heart disease has focused on serum levels of low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) and high-density lipoproteins (HDLs). One of the most fascinating discoveries is that high levels of HDLs reduce a person’s risk of developing heart disease, whereas high levels of LDLs increase that risk. Thus the serum LDL:HDL ratio is a better predictor of heart disease risk than the overall level of serum cholesterol. Persons who, because of hereditary or dietary factors, have high LDL:HDL ratios in their blood have a higher incidence of heart disease.</p>
            <p class="para" id="gob-ch17_s04_s01_p06">How do HDLs reduce the risk of developing heart disease? No one knows for sure, but one role of HDLs appears to be the transport of excess cholesterol to the liver, where it can be metabolized. Therefore, HDLs aid in removing cholesterol from blood and from the smooth muscle cells of the arterial wall.</p>
            <p class="para" id="gob-ch17_s04_s01_p07">Dietary modifications and increased physical activity can help lower total cholesterol and improve the LDL:HDL ratio. The average American consumes about 600 mg of cholesterol from animal products each day and also synthesizes approximately 1 g of cholesterol each day, mostly in the liver. The amount of cholesterol synthesized is controlled by the cholesterol level in the blood; when the blood cholesterol level exceeds 150 mg/100 mL, the rate of cholesterol biosynthesis is halved. Hence, if cholesterol is present in the diet, a feedback mechanism suppresses its synthesis in the liver. However, the ratio of suppression is not a 1:1 ratio; the reduction in biosynthesis does not equal the amount of cholesterol ingested. Thus, dietary substitutions of unsaturated fat for saturated fat, as well as a reduction in consumption of <em class="emphasis">trans</em> fatty acids, is recommended to help lower serum cholesterol and the risk of heart disease.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Steroid Hormones</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch17_s04_s02_p01"><em class="emphasis">Hormones</em> are chemical messengers that are released in one tissue and transported through the circulatory system to one or more other tissues. One group of hormones is known as steroid hormones because these hormones are synthesized from cholesterol, which is also a steroid. There are two main groups of steroid hormones: adrenocortical hormones and sex hormones.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch17_s04_s02_p02">The adrenocortical hormones, such as aldosterone and cortisol (<a class="xref" href="#gob-ch17_s04_s02_t01">Table 17.3 "Representative Steroid Hormones and Their Physiological Effects"</a>), are produced by the adrenal gland, which is located adjacent to each kidney. Aldosterone acts on most cells in the body, but it is particularly effective at enhancing the rate of reabsorption of sodium ions in the kidney tubules and increasing the secretion of potassium ions and/or hydrogen ions by the tubules. Because the concentration of sodium ions is the major factor influencing water retention in tissues, aldosterone promotes water retention and reduces urine output. Cortisol regulates several key metabolic reactions (for example, increasing glucose production and mobilizing fatty acids and amino acids). It also inhibits the inflammatory response of tissue to injury or stress. Cortisol and its analogs are therefore used pharmacologically as immunosuppressants after transplant operations and in the treatment of severe skin allergies and autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch17_s04_s02_p03">The sex hormones are a class of steroid hormones secreted by the gonads (ovaries or testes), the placenta, and the adrenal glands. Testosterone and androstenedione are the primary male sex hormones, or <em class="emphasis">androgens</em>, controlling the primary sexual characteristics of males, or the development of the male genital organs and the continuous production of sperm. Androgens are also responsible for the development of secondary male characteristics, such as facial hair, deep voice, and muscle strength. Two kinds of sex hormones are of particular importance in females: progesterone, which prepares the uterus for pregnancy and prevents the further release of eggs from the ovaries during pregnancy, and the estrogens, which are mainly responsible for the development of female secondary sexual characteristics, such as breast development and increased deposition of fat tissue in the breasts, the buttocks, and the thighs. Both males and females produce androgens and estrogens, differing in the amounts of secreted hormones rather than in the presence or absence of one or the other.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch17_s04_s02_p04">Sex hormones, both natural and synthetic, are sometimes used therapeutically. For example, a woman who has had her ovaries removed may be given female hormones to compensate. Some of the earliest chemical compounds employed in cancer chemotherapy were sex hormones. For example, estrogens are one treatment option for prostate cancer because they block the release and activity of testosterone. Testosterone enhances prostate cancer growth. Sex hormones are also administered in preparation for sex-change operations, to promote the development of the proper secondary sexual characteristics. Oral contraceptives are synthetic derivatives of the female sex hormones; they work by preventing ovulation.</p>

They are synthesized from cholesterol in the liver, stored in the gallbladder, and then secreted in bile into the small intestine.

        <p class="para editable block" id="gob-ch17_s04_s03_p02">Because they contain both hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups, bile salts are highly effective detergents and emulsifying agents; they break down large fat globules into smaller ones and keep those smaller globules suspended in the aqueous digestive environment. Enzymes can then hydrolyze fat molecules more efficiently. Thus, the major function of bile salts is to aid in the digestion of dietary lipids.</p>

This surgery does not seriously affect digestion because bile is still produced by the liver, but the liver’s bile is more dilute and its secretion into the small intestine is not as closely tied to the arrival of food.</p>

        <p class="para" id="gob-ch17_s05_p01"><em class="emphasis">To ensure that you understand the material in this chapter, you should review the meanings of the bold terms in the following summary and ask yourself how they relate to the topics in the chapter.</em></p>
        <p class="para" id="gob-ch17_s05_p02"><strong class="emphasis bold">Lipids</strong>, found in the body tissues of all organisms, are compounds that are more soluble in organic solvents than in water. Many of them contain <strong class="emphasis bold">fatty acids</strong>, which are carboxylic acids that generally contain an even number of 4–20 carbon atoms in an unbranched chain. <strong class="emphasis bold">Saturated fatty acids</strong> have no carbon-to-carbon double bonds. <strong class="emphasis bold">Monounsaturated fatty acids</strong> have a single carbon-to-carbon double bond, while <strong class="emphasis bold">polyunsaturated fatty acids</strong> have more than one carbon-to-carbon double bond. Linoleic and linolenic acid are known as <strong class="emphasis bold">essential fatty acids</strong> because the human body cannot synthesize these polyunsaturated fatty acids. The lipids known as <strong class="emphasis bold">fats</strong> and <strong class="emphasis bold">oils</strong> are triacylglycerols, more commonly called <strong class="emphasis bold">triglycerides</strong>—esters composed of three fatty acids joined to the trihydroxy alcohol glycerol. Fats are triglycerides that are solid at room temperature, and oils are triglycerides that are liquid at room temperature. Fats are found mainly in animals, and oils found mainly in plants. <em class="emphasis">Saturated triglycerides</em> are those containing a higher proportion of saturated fatty acid chains (fewer carbon-to-carbon double bonds); <em class="emphasis">unsaturated triglycerides</em> contain a higher proportion of unsaturated fatty acid chains.</p>
        <p class="para" id="gob-ch17_s05_p03"><strong class="emphasis bold">Saponification</strong> is the hydrolysis of a triglyceride in a basic solution to form glycerol and three carboxylate anions or soap molecules. Other important reactions are the hydrogenation and oxidation of double bonds in unsaturated fats and oils.</p>
        <p class="para" id="gob-ch17_s05_p04"><strong class="emphasis bold">Phospholipids</strong> are lipids containing phosphorus. In <strong class="emphasis bold">phosphoglycerides</strong>, the phosphorus is joined to an amino alcohol unit. Some phosphoglycerides, like lecithins, are used to stabilize an <strong class="emphasis bold">emulsion</strong>—a dispersion of two liquids that do not normally mix, such as oil and water. <strong class="emphasis bold">Sphingolipids</strong> are lipids for which the precursor is the amino alcohol sphingosine, rather than glycerol. A <strong class="emphasis bold">glycolipid</strong> has a sugar substituted at one of the OH groups of either glycerol or sphingosine. All are highly polar lipids found in cell membranes.</p>
        <p class="para" id="gob-ch17_s05_p05">Polar lipids have dual characteristics: one part of the molecule is ionic and dissolves in water; the rest has a hydrocarbon structure and dissolves in nonpolar substances. Often, the ionic part is referred to as <strong class="emphasis bold">hydrophilic</strong> (literally, “water loving”) and the nonpolar part as <strong class="emphasis bold">hydrophobic</strong> (“water fearing”). When placed in water, polar lipids disperse into any one of three arrangements: <em class="emphasis">micelles</em>, <em class="emphasis">monolayers</em>, and <em class="emphasis">bilayers</em>. <strong class="emphasis bold">Micelles</strong> are aggregations of molecules in which the hydrocarbon tails of the lipids, being hydrophobic, are directed inward (away from the surrounding water), and the hydrophilic heads that are directed outward into the water. <strong class="emphasis bold">Bilayers</strong> are double layers arranged so that the hydrophobic tails are sandwiched between the two layers of hydrophilic heads, which remain in contact with the water.</p>
        <p class="para" id="gob-ch17_s05_p06">Every living cell is enclosed by a <em class="emphasis">cell membrane</em> composed of a lipid bilayer. In animal cells, the bilayer consists mainly of phospholipids, glycolipids, and the steroid cholesterol. Embedded in the bilayer are <strong class="emphasis bold">integral proteins</strong>, and <strong class="emphasis bold">peripheral proteins</strong> are loosely associated with the surface of the bilayer. Everything between the cell membrane and the membrane of the cell nucleus is called the <strong class="emphasis bold">cytoplasm</strong>.</p>
        <p class="para" id="gob-ch17_s05_p07">Most lipids can be saponified, but some, such as <strong class="emphasis bold">steroids</strong>, cannot be saponified. The steroid <strong class="emphasis bold">cholesterol</strong> is found in animal cells but never in plant cells. It is a main component of all cell membranes and a precursor for hormones, vitamin D, and bile salts. Bile salts are the most important constituents of <strong class="emphasis bold">bile</strong>, which is a yellowish-green liquid secreted by the gallbladder into the small intestine and is needed for the proper digestion of lipids.</p>

Elaidic acid is a <em class="emphasis">trans</em> fatty acid, and the carbon chains can pack together almost as tightly as those of the saturated stearic acid. Oleic acid is a <em class="emphasis">cis</em> fatty acid, and the bend in the hydrocarbon chain keeps these carbon chains from packing as closely together; fewer interactions lead to a much lower melting point.</li>
