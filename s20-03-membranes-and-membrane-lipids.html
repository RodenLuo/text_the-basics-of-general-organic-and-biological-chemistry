(For more information about genetics and DNA, see <a class="xref" href="gob-ch19#gob-ch19">Chapter 19 "Nucleic Acids"</a>.) Everything between the cell membrane and the nuclear membrane—including intracellular fluids and various subcellular components such as the mitochondria and ribosomes—is called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">cytoplasm</a><span class="glossdef">Everything between the cell membrane and the nuclear membrane.</span></span>. The membranes of all cells have a fundamentally similar structure, but membrane function varies tremendously from one organism to another and even from one cell to another within a single organism. This diversity arises mainly from the presence of different proteins and lipids in the membrane.</p>

When allowed to float freely in water, polar lipids spontaneously cluster together in any one of three arrangements: micelles, monolayers, and bilayers (<a class="xref" href="#gob-ch17_s03_f03">Figure 17.5 "Spontaneously Formed Polar Lipid Structures in Water: Monolayer, Micelle, and Bilayer"</a>). <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Micelles</a><span class="glossdef">An aggregation in which a nonpolar tail is directed toward the center of the structure and the polar head is directed outward.</span></span> are aggregations in which the lipids’ hydrocarbon tails—being hydrophobic—are directed toward the center of the assemblage and away from the surrounding water while the hydrophilic heads are directed outward, in contact with the water. Each micelle may contain thousands of lipid molecules. Polar lipids may also form a monolayer, a layer one molecule thick on the surface of the water. The polar heads face into water, and the nonpolar tails stick up into the air. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Bilayers</a><span class="glossdef">A double layer of lipids arranged so that nonpolar tails are found between an inner surface and outer surface consisting of hydrophilic heads.</span></span> are double layers of lipids arranged so that the hydrophobic tails are sandwiched between an inner surface and an outer surface consisting of hydrophilic heads.

Bilayers like this make up every cell membrane (<a class="xref" href="#gob-ch17_s03_f04">Figure 17.6 "Schematic Diagram of a Cell Membrane"</a>).</p>

Because of considerable variation in their sugar components, about 130 varieties of gangliosides have been identified. Most cell-to-cell recognition and communication processes (e.g., blood group antigens) depend on differences in the sequences of sugars in these compounds. Gangliosides are most prevalent in the outer membranes of nerve cells, although they also occur in smaller quantities in the outer membranes of most other cells. Because cerebrosides and gangliosides contain sugar groups, they are also classified as glycolipids.</p>
